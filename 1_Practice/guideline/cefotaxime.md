Note: Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, dosing intervals of at least every 6 hours may be required to reach pharmacodynamic targets

- **Continuous infusion dosing:** Limited data available: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 100 to 200 mg/kg/day infused continuously over 24 hours; maximum daily dose: 12 g/day (Ref)

- **Endocarditis, treatment:** Children and Adolescents: IV: 200 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6 hours; maximum daily dose: 12 g/day; treat for ≥4 weeks depending on pathogen and valve type; longer durations may be necessary; use in combination with other antibiotics depending on pathogen

- **Intra-abdominal infection:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 150 to 200 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6 to 8 hours in combination with metronidazole; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose (Ref). Typical duration of therapy is 4 to 7 days

- **Meningitis: Infants, Children, and Adolescents:** IV: 225 to 300 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6 to 8 hours; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose; use in combination with vancomycin for empiric coverage; some experts recommend 300 mg/kg/day divided every 4 to 6 hours with a maximum daily dose of 12 g/day

- GFR 10 to 29 mL/minute/1.73 m2: 35 to 70 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours.
- GFR <10 mL/minute/1.73 m2: 35 to 70 mg/kg/dose every 24 hours.
- Intermittent hemodialysis: 35 to 70 mg/kg/dose every 24 hours.
- Peritoneal dialysis (PD): 35 to 70 mg/kg/dose every 24 hours.
- CRRT: 35 to 70 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours.


### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
No dosage adjustments

### Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to cefotaxime, other cephalosporins, or any component of the formulation.

### Warnings/Precautions
- Arrhythmia: A potentially life-threatening arrhythmia has been reported in patients who received a rapid (<1 minute) bolus injection via central venous catheter.
- Hematologic effects: Granulocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and more rarely agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, and pancytopenia may develop during prolonged treatment (>10 days).
- Penicillin allergy: Use with caution in patients with a history of penicillin allergy, especially IgE-mediated reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria).
- Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed >2 months postantibiotic treatment.
- Tissue inflammation: Minimize tissue inflammation by changing infusion sites when needed.

### Administration
- Maximum concentration 280 mg/mL for IM and 160 mg/mL for IV administration. 

- Intermittent infusion 10 – 40 mg/mL over 30 minutes.
- IV push: 200 mg/mL over 3 – 5 minutes. Rapid IV push (< 1 minute) of a cephalosporin has caused potentially life-threatening arrhythmias
-  Continuous infusion: May be used
- Suitable diluents D5W, D10W, NS, LR, D5NS, D5 ¼ NS, D5 ½ NS, sodium lactate injection

### Dosing for neonate
