 
## Vancomycin

### Preparation 
Available as powder for injection in 500-mg and 1-g vials. Reconstitute 500-mg and 1 g vial with 10 mL and 20 mL of sterile water for injection, respectively, to make a final concentration of 50 mg/mL. Reconstituted solution stable for 4 days refrigerated. Dilute prior to administration using D5W or NS to a maximum concentration of 5 mg/mL (concentrations up to 10 mg/mL may also be used in fluid restricted patients)

### General dosing

- **Maximun dosage**:  Although higher doses have been used, 60 mg/kg/day, not to exceed the  adult  dose of 4g/day, is still recommended

-	**General dosing:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: Initial: 45 to 60 mg/kg/day divided every 6 to 8 hours

-	**Note:** Based on adult data, an AUC24 target of 400 mg.hour/L is recommended in patients with serious methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections; specific dosing recommendations may be higher when targeting this range

-	**Endocarditis, treatment:** Dosage adjustment to target trough serum concentrations of 10 to 15 mg/L is recommended in pediatric endocarditis by the AHA. Dosage adjustment to target AUC24 of 400 mg.hour/L has been recommended in the treatment of proven or suspected MRSA infections based on adult data.
    + Empiric therapy/culture negative: Children and Adolescents: IV: Initial: 60 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours; initial maximum daily dose: 2,000 mg/day; use in combination with other antibiotics for at least 4 to 6 weeks; longer duration may be required if prosthetic material is present or in cases of recurrent endocarditis

-	**Enterocolitis (S. aureus)** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Oral: 40 mg/kg/day divided every 6 to 8 hours for 7 to 10 days; maximum daily dose: 2,000 mg/day

-	**Meningitis, including health care–associated meningitis:** Limited data available: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: Initial: 15 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours. Higher initial doses have been recommended for patients with serious MRSA infection with normal renal function, though dosing based on studies and models that were not specific to meningitis 

-	**Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, serious:**
    
    + Note: Doses should be adjusted based on patient-specific serum concentrations to a target AUC24 of 400 mg•hour/L, but potentially up to 600 mg•hour/L, based on adult data. In pediatric patients, an AUC24 of ≥400 mg•hour/L has been associated with trough concentrations of 7 to 10 mg/L, though trough concentrations do not clearly predict AUC on an individual level and trough-only monitoring is not recommended. Some studies have indicated that doses on the lower end of the range (ie, 60 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours) will achieve target AUC24 in most children. To minimize risk of acute kidney injury, maintain AUC24 <800 mg•hour/L and trough <15 mg/L. For patients with obesity, start with a one-time loading dose of 20 mg/kg (based on total body weight), then start maintenance dosing.
    
    + Infants ≥3 months and Children <12 years: IV: Initial: 60 to 80 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6 hours; initial maximum daily dose: 3,600 mg/day.
    
    + Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: IV: Initial: 60 to 70 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6 to 8 hours; initial maximum daily dose: 3,600 mg/day.

-	**Osteoarticular infection (eg, bacterial arthritis, osteomyelitis), acute:**
    + Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: Initial: 40 to 60 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6 to 8 hours. Higher initial doses have been recommended for patients with serious MRSA infection with normal kidney function
    + Duration of therapy: Minimum total duration is 10 to 14 days for bacterial arthritis and 21 to 28 days for osteomyelitis; however, duration for infections caused by MRSA commonly require longer durations; individualize based on several factors, including causative pathogen, response to therapy, and normalization of inflammatory markers

-	**Pneumonia, community acquired:** Infants >3 months, Children, and Adolescents: IV: Initial: 40 to 60 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6 to 8 hours. Note: Higher doses may be necessary when treating MRSA infections; doses should be adjusted based on patient-specific serum concentrations to a target AUC24 of 400 mg•hour/L

-	**Skin and soft tissue infection, complicated:** Note: Duration of treatment should be individualized and is dependent on severity of infection, adequacy of source control, and clinical improvement. For necrotizing fasciitis, continue treatment until further debridement is not necessary, patient has clinically improved, and patient is afebrile for 48 to 72 hours.

    + Necrotizing infections, mixed (non-MRSA): Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: Initial: 10 to 13 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours
    + Serious MRSA infection, including necrotizing infection and pyomyositis: Note: Dosage adjustment to target AUC24 of 400 mg•hour/L recommended for serious MRSA infections based on adult data. A loading dose of 20 mg/kg (based on total body weight) is recommended in patients with obesity
    + Infants ≥3 months and Children <12 years: IV: Initial: 60 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6 hours; maximum daily dose: 3,600 mg/day. Based on pharmacokinetic modeling studies, doses up to 80 mg/kg/day may be necessary to achieve target AUC24. 
    + Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: IV: Initial: 60 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6 to 8 hours; maximum daily dose: 3,600 mg/day. Based on pharmacokinetic modeling studies, doses up to 70 mg/kg/day may be necessary to achieve target AUC24. 


### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
No dosage adjustments necessary.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
- Oral: There are no dosage adjustments provided in manufacturer's labeling. 
- IV: Note: Vancomycin concentrations should be monitored in patients with any renal impairment:
    + GFR 30 to 50 mL/minute/1.73 m2: 10 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours
    + GFR 10 to 29 mL/minute/1.73 m2: 10 mg/kg/dose every 18 to 24 hours
    + GFR <10 mL/minute/1.73 m2: 10 mg/kg/dose; redose based on serum concentrations

### Contraindications
- Documented hypersensitivity to vancomycin or any of its components. If possible, avoid in patients with previous severe hearing loss
- Rapid administration may cause exaggerated hypotension, including shock, 
and, rarely, cardiac arrest

### Warnings/Precautions
- Vancomycin may rarely cause life-threatening immune-mediated anaphylaxis, which may present as generalized and extensive pruritus and/or erythema of skin, respiratory distress, bronchospasm, hypoxia, and hypotension. Clinical presentation is similar to vancomycin infusion reaction (a nonimmune-mediated anaphylactoid infusion-related reaction; formerly called “red man syndrome”), making it difficult for clinicians to distinguish between the 2 reactions 
- Onset: Rapid; IgE-mediated reactions generally occur within 1 hour of administration but may occur up to 6 hours after exposure. In a systematic review analyzing 7 case reports of vancomycin-induced anaphylaxis, the median time to onset of signs/symptoms was 2 minutes
- Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea and Clostridioides difficile colitis have been reported with intravenous vancomycin 
- Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) has been associated with use
- Maculopapular rash and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), toxic epidermal necrosis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), have occurred rarely with use and may be life-threatening 
- Systemic exposure is associated with nephrotoxicity (usually reversible), which may result in kidney impairment (or kidney failure), predominantly occurring in patients with multiple risk factors 
- Neutropenia (severe) and agranulocytosis have been observed in numerous case reports and case series; in some cases, drug fever also accompanied the neutropenia. Reversible pancytopenia has also been reported in case reports 

### Administration
- Maximum concentration: < 5 mg/mL. May use 10 mg/mL in fluid-restricted patients, but the risk of infusion reactions increase
- Intermittent infusion < 5 mg/mL over 60 minutes. Administration over < 60 minutes may cause red man syndrome. Thrombophlebitis can be minimized by using dilute solutions (e.g., 2.5 – 5 mg/mL) and rotating injection sites
- IV push: Not recommended
- Continuous infusion: May be given by continuous IV infusion. Vancomycin has a slow bactericidal activity and exhibits time-dependent killing. Some have proposed that administration by continuous infusion would maximize the time that vancomycin serum concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the suspected organism and thereby enhance efficacy, prevent bacterial regrowth, and perhaps decrease toxicity. Data for 
the administration of vancomycin by continuous infusion are extremely limited and have focused on  adults and neonates. A higher rate of nephrotoxicity occurred in  adult  patients receiving continuous infusions  
- Suitable diluents NS, LR, D5W, D5NS, D5LR
