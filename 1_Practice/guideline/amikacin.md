 
## Amikacin

### Preparation 


### General dosing

- **Maximum dosage**:  

- **Dosing consideration for obesity:** In obese pediatric patients, consider use of adjusted body weight (IBW + 0.4 [TBW – IBW]) to calculate initial dosage, based on experience with other aminoglycosides and in adult patients (Ref). Alternatively, adjusted body weight for obese pediatric patients may be calculated using the equation 0.7 x TBW. With other aminoglycosides (gentamicin), fat-free mass has been used to calculate the initial dose in pediatric patients ≥2 years of age regardless of body habitus. Dosage should then be individualized based upon serum concentration monitoring

- **General dosing:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Note: Extended-interval dosing is typically preferred:
Extended-interval dosing: Limited data available: IV, IM: 15 to 30 mg/kg/dose every 24 hours. Doses on the higher end of the range may be necessary in patients with critical illness, malignancy, cystic fibrosis, or burn injury, or for bacterial pathogens with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥4 mg/L.

- **CNS infection:** Meningitis, including health care-associated meningitis: Limited data available: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 20 to 30 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours; individualize duration based on patient characteristics, infecting bacteria, and response

- **Intra-abdominal infection, complicated:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 15 to 22.5 mg/kg/day divided every 8 to 24 hours


### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
No dosage adjustments necessary.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IM, IV:
The following adjustments have been recommended; Note: Renally adjusted dose recommendations are based on doses of 5 to 7.5 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours:

- GFR >50 mL/minute/1.73 m2: No adjustment required.
- GFR 30 to 50 mL/minute/1.73 m2: Administer every 12 to 18 hours.
- GFR 10 to 29 mL/minute/1.73 m2: Administer every 18 to 24 hours.
- GFR <10 mL/minute/1.73 m2: Administer every 48 to 72 hours.
- Intermittent hemodialysis: 5 mg/kg/dose; redose as indicated by serum concentrations.
- Peritoneal dialysis (PD): 5 mg/kg/dose; redose as indicated by serum concentrations.
- Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT): 7.5 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours, monitor serum concentrations.


### Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to amikacin, other aminoglycosides, or any component of the formulation

### Warnings/Precautions
-	Hypersensitivity: Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycosides may occur.
-	Nephrotoxicity: May cause nephrotoxicity; usual risk factors include preexisting renal impairment, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, advanced age and dehydration. Discontinue treatment if signs of nephrotoxicity occur; renal damage is usually reversible.
-	Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis: May cause neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis; especially when given soon after anesthesia or muscle relaxants
-	Neurotoxicity: May cause neurotoxicity; usual risk factors include preexisting renal impairment, concomitant neuro-/nephrotoxic medications, advanced age and dehydration. Ototoxicity is proportional to the amount of drug given and the duration of treatment. Tinnitus or vertigo may be indications of vestibular injury and impending bilateral irreversible damage. Discontinue treatment if signs of ototoxicity occur
-	Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed >2 months postantibiotic treatment.

### Administration
- Maximum concentration: 10 mg/mL. 
- Intermittent infusion: Over 30 – 60 minutes. Infusion over 1 – 2 hours is recommended in infants
- IV push: Although aminoglycosides have been given over 15 seconds, 1 minute, and 3 – 5 minutes, rapid infusion is not recommended
- Continous infusion: Not recommended. Has been given by continuous infusion
- Suitable diluents D5W, D10W, D20W, and NS

### Dosing for neonate
PMA is the primary determinant of dosing interval, with Postnatal Age as the secondary qualifier.
-	PMA (≤ 29 weeks) and PostNatal (0 to 7 days)  Dose 18 mg/kg, Interval (48 hours)
-	PMA (≤ 29 weeks) and PostNatal (8 to 28 days)  Dose 15 mg/kg, Interval (36 hours)
-	PMA (≤ 29 weeks) and PostNatal (≥ 29 days)  Dose 15 mg/kg, Interval (24 hours)
-	PMA (30 – 34 weeks) and PostNatal (0 to 7 days)  Dose 18 mg/kg, Interval (36 hours)
-	PMA (30 – 34 weeks) and PostNatal (≥ 8 days)  Dose 15 mg/kg, Interval (24 hours)
-	PMA (≥ 35 weeks) and ALL  Dose 15 mg/kg, Interval (24 hours)
