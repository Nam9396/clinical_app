### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
Note: Dosing is based on pharmacokinetic parameters, limited pediatric studies, adult recommendations, and expert opinion. Altered kidney function: < 50 need to be consider
- />25 to ≤50 mL/minute/1.73 m2: 40 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose
- 10 to ≤25 mL/minute/1.73 m2: 20 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours; maximum dose: 1,000 mg/dose

### Contraindications
- In patients with a hypersensitivity to meropenem or to other carbapenems or in patients who have had anaphylactic reactions to beta-lactams. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with beta lactams; these reactions are more likely to occur in those with a history of hypersensitivity to other beta-lactams or to multiple allergens

### Warnings/Precautions
- Carbapenems, including meropenem, may cause CNS toxicity. Meropenem is associated with a lower seizure risk than imipenem/cilastatin (Ref). Other CNS effects may include delirium, continuous epileptiform discharges, and myoclonic jerking. Seizures occur most commonly in patients with renal impairment and/or underlying neurologic disorders 
- Clostridioides difficile infection, including Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea, has been reported with meropenem
- Hypersensitivity reactions: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria. Delayed hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported and range from skin rash to rare severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (Ref), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Ref), and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
-  Thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients with renal dysfunction who are  receiving 
meropenem

### Administration
- Maximum concentration: 50 mg/mL 
- Intermittent infusion: 50 mg/mL over 15 – 30 minutes
- IV push: 50 mg/mL over 3 – 5 minutes
- Continous infusion: Not generally done. Meropenem has been administered as a 3-hour infusion for the treatment of CNS infections
- Suitable diluents D5W, D10W, and NS
