### Preparation 
Available as powder for injection in 500-mg and 1-g, and 2-g vials. Reconstitute 500 mg vial with 5 mL of sterile water for injection to a concentration of 100 mg/mL. Maximum concentration for IV administration is 160 mg/mL, and for IM administration 280 mg/mL

### General dosing:

Traditional intermittent-infusion method:

**Non-Pseudomonas spp. infections:** IM, IV: 50 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose 

**Pseudomonas spp. infections (suspected or proven):** IM, IV: 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose 

**Extended-infusion method:** Limited data available: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 50 mg/kg/dose infused over 3 to 4 hours every 8 hours; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose. Note: Extended-infusion dosing may be preferred for bacteria with elevated MICs (ie, 4 or 8 mg/L) or in critically ill patients.

**Febrile neutropenia, empiric therapy:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose; duration of therapy dependent upon febrile neutropenia risk-status; in high-risk patients, may discontinue empiric antibiotics if all of the following criteria met: Negative blood cultures at 48 hours; afebrile for at least 24 hours, and evidence of marrow recovery. In low-risk patients, may discontinue empiric antibiotics after 72 hours duration in patients with a negative blood culture and who have been afebrile for 24 hours regardless of marrow recovery status; follow-up closely.

**Intra-abdominal infection, complicated:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 50 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours in combination with metronidazole; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose. Note: IDSA guidelines recommend duration of 4 to 7 days (provided source controlled)

**Meningitis, including health care–associated ventriculitis/meningitis:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose. Duration should be individualized based on patient characteristics and response; treatment duration for gram-negative bacilli is a minimum of 10 to 14 days, although some experts recommend ≥21 days and at least 14 days after first negative cerebrospinal fluid culture.
Peritonitis (peritoneal dialysis):

**Pneumonia, moderate to severe:**

Infants ≥2 months, Children, and Adolescents:

- Due to P. aeruginosa: IV: 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for 10 days; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose.
- Not due to P. aeruginosa: IV: 50 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours for 10 days; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose.

**Skin and skin structure infection, uncomplicated:** Infants ≥2 months, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 50 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours for 10 days; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose.

**Urinary tract infection (UTI):**
Infants, Children, and Adolescents (limited data available in ages <2 months):

- Uncomplicated infection: IM, IV: 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 to 12 hours. Maximum dose: Mild to moderate infection: 1,000 mg/dose; severe infection: 2,000 mg/dose (Ref). Note: IM administration is only FDA approved for mild to moderate infections due to E. coli.
- Complicated infection, including pyelonephritis: IV: 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 to 12 hours; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose (Ref). While manufacturer labeling allows every-12-hour dosing, published studies have utilized every-8-hour-dosing for complicated infection (Ref).
- Duration of therapy: Should be individualized based on patient-specific factors such as age, severity/extent of infection, clinical response, etc; some patients may require longer than the minimum treatment duration (eg, patients with slower clinical improvement or more complicated disease). For uncomplicated cystitis, 5 days of total treatment is typically adequate (Ref). For complicated UTI, including pyelonephritis, or hospitalized patients, total treatment (IV and oral) for 7 to 10 days is likely appropriate; longer duration (≥10 days) was not shown to improve outcomes as compared to shorter duration (6 to 9 days) in an observational study of patients ≥6 months of age (Ref).
