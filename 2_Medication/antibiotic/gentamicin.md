 
## Gentamicin

### Preparation 
Pediatric injectable solution available in a concentration of 10 mg/mL. 

### General dosing

- **Maximum dosage**: No information

-	**Dosing consideration for obesity:** In obese pediatric patients, use adjusted body weight (IBW + 0.4 [TBW – IBW]) to calculate initial dosage (Ref). Alternatively, adjusted body weight for obese pediatric patients may be calculated using the equation 0.7 x TBW, or fat-free mass can be used to calculate the initial dose in pediatric patients ≥2 years regardless of body habitus (Ref). Dosage should then be individualized based upon serum concentration monitoring.

-	**General dosing, susceptible infection**
    + Conventional dosing: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IM, IV: 2 to 2.5 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours
    + Extended-interval dosing: Limited data available: Weight-directed: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 5 to 7.5 mg/kg/dose every 24 hours in patients with normal renal function

-	**Intra-abdominal infection, complicated:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 3 to 7.5 mg/kg/day divided every 8 to 24 hours; use in combination with other antibiotics

-	**Urinary tract infection (UTI):**
    + Note: Duration of therapy for multiple-dose regimens: For uncomplicated cystitis in patients ≥3 months of age, treat for 3 to 5 days; patients <2 years of age may require a longer course (eg, 7 days). For complicated UTI, including pyelonephritis, treat for a total of 6 to 10 days; while 7 to 14 days has been recommended for complicated UTI, this was not shown to improve outcomes compared to a shorter duration of 6 to 10 days
    + Conventional dosing: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 7.5 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours until clinical improvement and able to tolerate oral intake; complete course with oral antibiotics. Duration should be individualized based upon age, severity, and degree of urinary tract involvement.


### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
No dosage adjustments necessary.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
Note: Renally adjusted dose recommendations are based on doses of 2.5 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours:
-	GFR >50 mL/minute/1.73 m2: No dosage adjustment necessary.
-	GFR 30 to 50 mL/minute/1.73 m2: Administer every 12 to 18 hours.
-	GFR 10 to 29 mL/minute/1.73 m2: Administer every 18 to 24 hours.
-	GFR <10 mL/minute/1.73 m2: Administer every 48 to 72 hours.
-	Intermittent hemodialysis: 2 mg/kg/dose; redose as indicated by serum concentration.
-	Peritoneal dialysis (PD): 2 mg/kg/dose; redose as indicated by serum concentration.
-	Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT): 2 to 2.5 mg/kg/dose every 12 to 24 hours, monitor serum concentrations.

### Contraindications


### Warnings/Precautions
-	Hypersensitivity: Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycosides may occur.
-	Nephrotoxicity: [US Boxed Warning]: May cause nephrotoxicity; usual risk factors include preexisting renal impairment, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, advanced age and dehydration. Discontinue treatment if signs of nephrotoxicity occur; renal damage is usually reversible.
-	Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis: May cause neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis; especially when given soon after anesthesia or neuromuscular blockers.
-	Neurotoxicity: [US Boxed Warning]: May cause neurotoxicity; usual risk factors include preexisting renal impairment, concomitant neuro-/nephrotoxic medications, advanced age and dehydration. Ototoxicity is proportional to the amount of drug given and the duration of treatment. Tinnitus or vertigo may be indications of vestibular injury and impending bilateral irreversible damage. Discontinue treatment if signs of ototoxicity occur.
-	Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed >2 months postantibiotic treatment.
-	Electrolyte abnormalities: Use with caution in patients with hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesemia.
-	Hearing impairment: Use with caution in patients with preexisting vertigo, tinnitus, or hearing loss.

### Administration
- Maximum concentration: no information
- May be administered IM
- Intermittent infusion 10 – 40 mg/mL over 30 minutes
- IV push and continuous infusion: not recommended
- Suitable diluents D5W, D10W, and NS
- **Neofax notice**: Give as an IV infusion by syringe pump over 30 minutes. Administer as a separate infusion from penicillin-containing compounds. IM injection is associated with variable absorption, especially in the very small infant

### Dosing for neonate
Renal function and drug elimination are most strongly correlated with Postmenstrual Age (PMA; equivalent to Gestational Age plus Postnatal Age). PMA is the primary determinant of dosing interval, with Postnatal Age as the secondary qualifier.

-	PMA (≤ 29 weeks) and PostNatal (0 to 7 days) - Dose 5 mg/kg, Interval (48 hours)
-	PMA (≤ 29 weeks) and PostNatal (8 to 28 days) - Dose 4 mg/kg, Interval (36 hours)
-	PMA (≤ 29 weeks) and PostNatal (≥ 29 days) - Dose 4 mg/kg, Interval (24 hours)
-	PMA (30 – 34 weeks) and PostNatal (0 to 7 days) - Dose 4.5 mg/kg, Interval (36 hours)
-	PMA (30 – 34 weeks) and PostNatal (≥ 8 days) - Dose 4 mg/kg, Interval (24 hours)
-	PMA (≥ 35 weeks) and ALL - Dose 4 mg/kg, Interval (24 hours)
