### General dosing

- **Maximun dosage**:  Not to exceed 4.8 g/day in  adults, not to exceed 1200 mg in a single, 1-hour infusion. 600 mg IM is the maximum dose

-	**Dosing:** Dosing presented in mg/kg/dose and mg/kg/day; use caution. Dosage should be based on total body weight for children ≥2 years of age and adolescents with and without obesity

-	**General dosing:**
    + IM, IV: 20 to 40 mg/kg/day divided every 6 to 8 hours; maximum daily dose: 2,700 mg/day
    + Oral: 10 to 25 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours; higher doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day divided every 6 to 8 hours recommended for some infections, see specific indication; maximum daily dose: 1,800 mg/day.

-	**Exit-site or tunnel infection, peritoneal dialysis catheter:** Infant, Children, and Adolescents: Oral: 10 mg/kg/dose 3 times daily; maximum dose: 450 mg/dose 

-	**Osteoarticular infection, acute (eg, bacterial arthritis, osteomyelitis):** 
    + Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV, Oral: 30 to 40 mg/kg/day divided every 6 to 8 hours; maximum dose: IV: 900 mg/dose; Oral: 600 mg/dose. 
    + Duration should be individualized based on several factors including causative pathogen, response to therapy, and normalization of inflammatory markers. 
        - For acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, the minimum total duration is 3 to 4 weeks of therapy. 
        - For acute bacterial arthritis, typical duration is 3 to 4 weeks, but courses as short as 10 to 14 days may be considered in patients with adequate source control who improve rapidly with a consistent, progressive decrease in C-reactive protein by the end of the first week. Longer duration commonly necessary, particularly for infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)

-	**Pneumonia, community acquired: Note:** Duration dependent upon pathogen and clinical course. Typical duration for uncomplicated infections is 5 to 10 days; however, infections caused by MRSA may require longer treatment

    + Mild infection or oral step-down therapy: Oral: 30 to 40 mg/kg/day divided every 6 to 8 hours; maximum daily dose: 1,800 mg/day.

-	**Skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI):**
    + Impetigo, ecthyma (if MRSA is suspected or confirmed): Oral: 20 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 hours for 7 days; maximum dose: 400 mg/dose.
    + Cellulitis, erysipelas, purulent/fluctuant SSTI: Note: Typical duration is 5 days for uncomplicated infection but may be extended if clinical response is inadequate.

### Contraindications


### Warnings/Precautions
-	Renal toxicity: Acute kidney injury has been reported; discontinue treatment if clindamycin-induced acute kidney injury is suspected and no other etiology is identified.
-	Superinfection: Use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, particularly yeast. Should superinfection occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation.
-	GI disease: Use with caution in patients with a history of GI disease, particularly colitis.
-	Liver impairment: Use with caution in patients with moderate to severe liver disease; however, when administered at every-8-hour intervals, drug accumulation is rare.
-	Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; acute kidney injury may occur, especially if patient is taking other nephrotoxins concurrently.
