### Contraindications
-   In patients with a known hypersensitivity to any component of this product or to other carbapenems or in patients who have demonstrated anaphylactic reactions to beta-lactams


### Warnings/Precautions
-	CNS effects: Carbapenems have been associated with CNS adverse effects, including confusional states and seizures (myoclonic); use caution with CNS disorders (eg, brain lesions and history of seizures) and adjust dose in renal impairment to avoid drug accumulation, which may increase seizure risk. However, there have been reports of adverse CNS effects in patients who had no recognized or documented underlying CNS disorder or compromised renal function.

-	Hypersensitivity reactions: Serious hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions have been reported, including fatalities; may be more common in patients with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Patients with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity may experience severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with other beta-lactams; carefully inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other beta-lactams, and other allergens. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate discontinuation and supportive care as clinically indicated.

-	Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed >2 months postantibiotic treatment

- Valproic acid and derivatives: Carbapenems, including imipenem, may decrease the serum concentration of divalproex sodium/valproic acid increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Concurrent use of carbapenem antibiotics with divalproex sodium/valproic acid is generally not recommended. Alternative antimicrobial agents should be considered, but if a concurrent carbapenem is necessary, consider additional antiseizure medication.


### Administration
