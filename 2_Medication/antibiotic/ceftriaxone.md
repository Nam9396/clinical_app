### Dosing: Liver Impairment, Kidney Impairment
Most patients with renal dysfunction who receive ≤ 2 g/day do not require dosage adjustment. However, some patients with end-stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis may accumulate cefTRIAXone. It is recommended that patients with a GFR < 10 receive 
their dose every 24 hours only. No adjustment in hepatic dysfunction; however, if both hepatic and renal dysfunction the dosage should not exceed 2 g/day.  

### Contraindications
- Should not be used in those with a known allergy to cefTRIAXone or another cephalosporin antibiotics. CefTRIAXone can displace bilirubin from its binding sites on serum albumin and may cause kernicterus and encephalopathy in hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially premature neonates.  
- CefTRIAXone must not be co-administered with calcium-containing IV solutions (e.g., Ringer ’ s solution, Hartmann ’ s solution, and PN formulations that contain calcium) in neonates because of the risk of precipitation of cefTRIAXone – calcium salt. 
- CefTRIAXone should not be administered simultaneously with any 
calcium-containing solution via Y-site in any patient. (3) 

### Warnings/Precautions
- Elevated INR: May be associated with increased INR (rarely), especially in nutritionally deficient patients, prolonged treatment, hepatic or renal disease. Monitor INR during treatment if patient has impaired synthesis or low stores of vitamin K; supplementation may be needed if clinically indicated.
- Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection.
- CefTRIAXone has been reported to cause primary cholelithiasis, nephrolithiasis,
and hemolytic anemia. Gallstones spontaneously resolved after discontinuation of the drug. Cases of pancreatitis, possibly secondary to biliary obstruction, have been reported rarely in patients treated with cefTRIAXone
- Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced.   

### Administration
- Maximum concentration 40 mg/mL for IV administration and 350 mg/mL for IM use
- Intermittent infusion 10 – 40 mg/mL over 30 minutes.
- IV push: 10 – 40 mg/mL. Although infusion over 30 minutes is now recommended doses have been given over 2 – 3 minutes in ambulatory patients  > 11 years of age, over 5 minutes in children with meningitis and 10 – 15 minutes in serious bacterial infections in  children. Cholelithiasis has been reported to occur more frequently with bolus infusions in children
- Suitable diluents D5NS, D5 ½ NS, D5W, D10W, NS, or SW.
