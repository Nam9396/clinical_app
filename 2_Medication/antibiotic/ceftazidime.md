 
## Ceftazidime

### Preparation 
Prepared by reconstituting 500-mg vial with 2.2 mL of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine or Sterile Water to a concentration of 200 mg/mL. Solution is stable for 12 hours at room temperature, 3 days refrigerated

### General dosing

-	**General dosing:**
    + Non-Pseudomonas spp. infections: IM, IV: 90 to 150 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours; maximum daily dose: 6 g/day 
    + Pseudomonas spp. infections:
        - Mild to moderate infections: IM, IV: 90 to 150 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours; maximum daily dose: 6 g/day 
        - Severe infections: IM, IV: 200 to 300 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours; maximum daily dose: 12 g/day 

-	**Endocarditis, treatment:** Children and Adolescents: IV: 100 to 150 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours; maximum daily dose: 4,000 mg/day. Duration depends on causative pathogen, presence of prosthetic material, and patient response; typically ≥6 weeks for gram-negative endocarditis 

-	**Intra-abdominal infection, complicated:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 150 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours as part of an appropriate combination regimen (eg, with metronidazole); maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose. Duration of treatment is 4 to 7 days if source is adequately controlled

-	**Meningitis, including health care–associated ventriculitis/meningitis:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 150 to 200 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 hours; maximum daily dose: 6 g/day. Duration should be individualized based on patient characteristics and response; treatment duration for gram-negative bacilli is a minimum of 10 to 14 days, although some experts recommend ≥21 days and at least 14 days after first negative cerebrospinal fluid culture coverage

-	**Neutropenic fever, treatment (known susceptible gram-negative bacteria):** Limited data available: Note: Ceftazidime is typically not recommended for empiric management of neutropenic fever 

-	**Urinary tract infection (UTI):** 
    + Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 100 to 150 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours; maximum daily dose: 6 g/day. 
    + Duration of therapy should be individualized based on patient age, severity/extent of infection, and clinical response; for uncomplicated cystitis in patients ≥3 months of age, 5 days of treatment may be adequate, though patients <2 years of age may require a longer course (eg, 7 days). For complicated UTI, including pyelonephritis, treat for a total of 6 to 10 days; while 7 to 14 days has been recommended for complicated UTI, this was not shown to improve outcomes compared to a shorter duration of 6 to 10 days


### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
No dosage adjustments necessary.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
Infants, Children, and Adolescents: The manufacturer recommends decreasing dosing frequency based on the calculated BSA-adjusted creatinine clearance. The following guidelines have been used by some clinicians (Ref): Note: Renally adjusted dose recommendations are based on a usual dose of 25 to 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours:

- GFR >50 mL/minute/1.73 m2: No adjustment required.
- GFR 30 to 50 mL/minute/1.73 m2: 50 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours.
- GFR 10 to 29 mL/minute/1.73 m2: 50 mg/kg/dose every 24 hours.
- GFR <10 mL/minute/1.73 m2: 50 mg/kg/dose every 48 hours.
- Hemodialysis: Dialyzable (50% to 100%): 50 mg/kg/dose every 48 hours, give after dialysis on dialysis days.
- Peritoneal dialysis: 50 mg/kg/dose every 48 hours.
Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT): 50 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours.


### Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to ceftazidime, other cephalosporins, penicillins, other beta-lactam antibiotics, or any component of the formulation

### Warnings/Precautions
-	Elevated INR: May be associated with increased INR, especially in nutritionally deficient patients, prolonged treatment, hepatic or renal disease. Monitor INR during treatment if patient is at risk; administer vitamin K as clinically indicated.
-	Hemolytic anemia: Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, sometimes fatal, has been observed in patients receiving cephalosporins, including ceftazidime. If a patient develops anemia while on ceftazidime, discontinue treatment until the etiology is determined.
-	Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam drugs. Use caution in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to penicillins or other beta-lactams; use is contraindicated in patients with cephalosporin allergy (according to the manufacturer). If severe hypersensitivity occurs, discontinue immediately and institute supportive emergency measures.
-	Neurotoxicity: High ceftazidime levels in patients with renal insufficiency can lead to seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus, encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, myoclonia, and neuromuscular excitability. Adjust dosage based on renal function.
-	Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including Clostridioides difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed >2 months postantibiotic treatment.


### Administration
- Maximum concentration 170 mg/mL
- Intermittent infusion: 10 – 40 mg/mL over 30 minutes.
