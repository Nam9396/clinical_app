### General dosing

-	**General dosing:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV, IM: 100 to 200 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 4 to 6 hours; maximum daily dose: 12 g/day

-	**Endocarditis, treatment:** Children and Adolescents: IV: 200 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 4 to 6 hours; maximum daily dose: 12 g/day. Treat for at least 4 to 6 weeks; duration should be individualized based on presentation, valve type, and response to therapy

-	**Meningitis/Ventriculitis:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 200 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6 hours; maximum daily dose: 12 g/day 

-	**Osteoarticular infection, acute** (eg, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis): Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 150 to 200 mg/kg/day divided every 4 to 6 hours; maximum daily dose: 12 g/day. May transition to oral therapy as appropriate (eg, response to initial parenteral therapy, oral option available). Minimum total duration is 2 to 3 weeks for septic arthritis and 3 to 4 weeks for osteomyelitis; however, duration should be individualized based on several factors, including causative pathogen, response to therapy, and normalization of inflammatory markers.

-	**Pneumonia, community acquired (CAP), moderate to severe, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA):**
Infants >3 months, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 150 to 200 mg/kg/day divided every 6 to 8 hours. 

-	**Skin and soft tissue infection**
    + MSSA (non-necrotizing infection): IV: 100 to 150 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6 hours; maximum daily dose: 12 g/day.
    + Necrotizing infection due to MSSA: IV: 200 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6 hours; maximum daily dose: 12 g/day; continue until further debridement is not necessary, patient has clinically improved, and patient is afebrile for 48 to 72 hours.


### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
No dosage adjustments necessary.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV, IM: There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling; however, oxacillin is eliminated via the kidney; monitoring is recommended. High oxacillin concentrations and neurotoxicity have been reported in adult patients with severe kidney impairment; monitor closely 

### Contraindications
Hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylaxis) to oxacillin, any penicillin, or any component of the formulation

### Warnings/Precautions
-	Anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reactions: Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy, especially with a history of beta-lactam hypersensitivity, history of sensitivity to multiple allergens, or previous IgE-mediated reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria). Use with caution in patients with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma; discontinue treatment and institute appropriate therapy if an allergic reaction occurs
-	Hepatitis: Acute hepatitis and reversible elevations of serum transaminases have been reported sometimes accompanied by rash and leukopenia; onset after 2 to 3 weeks of therapy
-	Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed >2 months postantibiotic treatment.

### Administration
- Maximum concentration 100 mg/mL for IV push
- Intermittent infusion: If given peripherally, consider infusing over 60 minutes at a maximum 
concentration of 20 mg/mL
- IV push: 100 mg/mL over at least 10 minutes.
- Suitable diluents D5W, D10W, and NS.

### Dosing for neonate
- Usual dosage: 25 mg/kg/dose IV over at least 10 minutes. 
- Meningitis: 50 mg/kg/dose IV over at least 10 minutes. 
- Antibiotic Dosing Chart: Renal function and drug elimination are most strongly correlated with Postmenstrual Age (PMA; equivalent to Gestational Age plus Postnatal Age). PMA is the primary determinant of dosing interval, with Postnatal Age as the secondary qualifier.
    -	PMA (≤ 29 weeks) and PostNatal (0 to 28 days): Interval (12 hours)
    -	PMA (≤ 29 weeks) and PostNatal (> 28 days): Interval (8 hours)
    -	PMA (30 - 36 weeks) and PostNatal (0 to 14 days): Interval (12 hours)
    -	PMA (30 – 36 weeks) and PostNatal (> 14 days): Interval (8 hours)
    -	PMA (37 – 44 weeks) and PostNatal (0 to 7 days): Interval (12 hours)
    -	PMA (37 – 44 weeks) and PostNatal (> 7 days): Interval (8 hours)
    -	PMA (> 45 weeks): Interval (6 hours)
