### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
- Mild or moderate impairment: No dosage adjustment necessary; use with caution and monitor for adverse events.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
Renally adjusted dose recommendations are based on doses of 15 to 30 mg/kg/day divided every 6 to 8 hours.
- GFR ≥10 mL/minute/1.73 m2: No adjustment required.
- GFR <10 mL/minute/1.73 m2: 4 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours.

### Warnings/Precautions
Metronidazole has been associated with a range of CNS effects, which include peripheral neuropathy, aseptic meningitis, ataxia, neuro cerebellar toxicity, confusion or disorientation, dysarthria, encephalopathy, seizures, optic neuropathy, and vertigo. Most reports have occurred in adults; however, there are reports in pediatric patients . CNS effects are generally reversible within days to weeks of discontinuation of therapy; however, some cases may not be reversible. Peripheral neuropathy symptoms may be prolonged after discontinuation.

- Antibiotic Dosing Chart: Renal function and drug elimination are most strongly correlated with Postmenstrual Age (PMA; equivalent to Gestational Age plus Postnatal Age). PMA is the primary determinant of dosing interval, with Postnatal Age as the secondary qualifier.
    -	PMA (≤ 29 weeks) and PostNatal (0 to 28 days): Interval (48 hours)
    -	PMA (≤ 29 weeks) and PostNatal (> 28 days): Interval (24 hours)
    -	PMA (30 - 36 weeks) and PostNatal (0 to 14 days): Interval (24 hours)
    -	PMA (30 – 36 weeks) and PostNatal (> 14 days): Interval (12 hours)
    -	PMA (37 – 44 weeks) and PostNatal (0 to 7 days): Interval (24 hours)
    -	PMA (37 – 44 weeks) and PostNatal (> 7 days): Interval (12 hours)
    -	PMA (> 45 weeks): Interval (8 hours)
