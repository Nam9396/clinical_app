### General dosing

-	**Sedation, anxiolysis, and amnesia prior to procedure or before induction of anesthesia:**

    + IM: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IM: Usual dose: 0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg 30 to 60 minutes before surgery or procedure; range: 0.05 to 0.15 mg/kg; doses up to 0.5 mg/kg have been used in more anxious patients; maximum total dose: 10 mg.
    + IV:
        - Infants <6 months: IV: Limited data available in nonintubated infants; infants <6 months are at higher risk for airway obstruction and hypoventilation; titrate dose with small increments to desired clinical effect; monitor carefully.
        - Infants ≥6 months to Children <6 years: IV: Initial: 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg; titrate dose carefully to desired clinical effect; total dose of 0.6 mg/kg may be required; usual maximum total dose: 6 mg.
        - Children ≥6 years: IV: Initial: 0.025 to 0.05 mg/kg; titrate dose carefully to desired clinical effect; total doses of 0.4 mg/kg may be required; usual maximum total dose: 10 mg.
        - Adolescents: IV: Initial: 1 to 2.5 mg over ≥2 minutes; titrate dose carefully to desired clinical effect; usual maximum total dose: 10 mg. Note: Based on experience in adults, smaller initial doses (eg, 0.5 mg) may be considered

-	**Sedation, mechanically ventilated patient:** 
Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: Loading dose: 0.05 to 0.2 mg/kg given slow IV over ≥2 to 3 minutes, then follow with initial continuous IV infusion: 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/hour; titrate to the desired effect; maximum initial dose: 10 mg/hour

    + Sedation tapering (after prolonged therapy): After prolonged therapy, consider a slow taper of therapy or conversion to a long-acting benzodiazepine to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal
    + If duration of therapy <3 to 5 days: Decrease dose by 10% to 15% every 6 to 8 hours ; monitor closely for signs and symptoms of withdrawal with each reduction in dose.
    + If duration of therapy >5 days, the following regimens have been reported:
        - Conversion to oral diazepam: After first dose of oral diazepam, decrease midazolam infusion by 50%; after the second dose of oral diazepam, discontinue the midazolam infusion; monitor closely for signs and symptoms of withdrawal with each reduction in dose.
        - Conversion to oral lorazepam: After second dose of oral lorazepam, decrease midazolam infusion by 50%; after third dose of oral lorazepam, decrease the midazolam infusion by an additional 50%; after fourth dose of oral lorazepam, discontinue the midazolam infusion; monitor closely for signs and symptoms of withdrawal with each reduction in dose.

-	**Seizures, acute treatment:**
    + IM: Limited data available:
    Weight-directed dosing: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IM: 0.2 mg/kg/dose
    + Fixed dosing
    13 to 40 kg: IM: 5 mg.
    />40 kg: IM: 10 mg.

- **Status epilepticus:** Standard treatment: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Limited data available:
    + IM: Weight-based dosing: IM: 0.2 mg/kg once; maximum dose: 10 mg/dose 
    + Refractory to standard treatment: Note: Mechanical ventilation and cardiovascular monitoring required; titrate dose to cessation of electrographic seizures or burst suppression.
        + Loading dose: IV: 0.2 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion.
        + Continuous IV infusion: 0.05 to 2 mg/kg/hour, titrated to cessation of electrographic seizures or burst suppression. If patient experiences breakthrough status epilepticus while on the continuous infusion, administer a bolus of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg and increase infusion rate by 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg/hour every 3 to 4 hours.


### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
No dosage adjustments necessary.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling; use with caution; half-life of midazolam and metabolites may be prolonged. 

### Contraindications
Injection, oral: Hypersensitivity to midazolam or any component of the formulation; intrathecal or epidural injection of parenteral forms containing preservatives (ie, benzyl alcohol); use in premature infants for parenteral forms containing benzyl alcohol; acute narrow-angle glaucoma.
Concurrent use of oral midazolam with protease inhibitors (atazanavir, atazanavir-cobicistat, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir-ritonavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, tipranavir); concurrent use of oral or injectable midazolam with fosamprenavir.


### Warnings/Precautions
-	Cardiorespiratory effects: Serious cardiorespiratory adverse events have occurred with midazolam administration, including cardiac arrest, permanent neurologic injury, and death. Risk of adverse events is increased in patients with abnormal airway anatomy, cyanotic congenital heart disease, sepsis, or severe pulmonary disease. In patients with a risk of respiratory depression, consider administering the first dose of intranasal midazolam under health care supervision; this may be performed in the absence of a seizure episode.
-	CNS depression: May cause CNS depression, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks that require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery, driving). 
-	Hypotension: May cause hypotension, particularly in pediatric patients or patients with hemodynamic instability. Hypotension may occur more frequently in patients who have received opioid analgesics.
-	Paradoxical reactions: Paradoxical reactions, including hyperactive or aggressive behavior, have been reported with benzodiazepines; risk may be increased in adolescent/pediatric patients, older adults, or patients with a history of alcohol use disorder or psychiatric/personality disorders



### Administration
- Maximum concentration: < 5 mg/mL for IV push, 1 mg/mL for IM administration
- Intermittent infusion: >= 2 minutes
- IV push: 1 or 5 mg/mL given over 20 – 30 seconds for anesthesia induction. Rapid administration (< 2 minutes) may cause severe hypotension in neonates, especially if concurrent fentanyl 
is given. Seizures have also been reported in neonates following rapid administration
- Continuous infusion: Diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL with NS or D5W 
- Suitable diluents D5W, NS, and sterile water for injection
- Other routes: 
    -	Buccal: A buccal formulation is not currently available in the United States. 
    -	Intranasal: The nasal spray formulation (Nayzilam) delivers a fixed dose of 5 mg and is not appropriate for all pediatric patients; 
    -	Rectal: Clinical trials utilized parenteral midazolam for rectal administration; administer a 1 to 5 mg/mL solution through a small, lubricated catheter or tube inserted rectally; hold buttocks closed for ~5 minutes after administration 

### Dosing for neonate
-	**Endotracheal intubation, premedication:**
PMA >32 weeks: IM, IV: 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg/dose over 2 to 5 minutes; use in combination with other medications 

-	**Neonatal seizures, refractory:** 
    
    Limited data available; dosage regimens variable, reported doses are higher than sedative doses. Note: Consider omitting loading dose if patient has received an IV dose of another benzodiazepine; begin continuous IV infusion at lower end of range and titrate to lowest effective dose:
    
    Preterm and term neonates: Loading dose: IV: 0.05 to 0.15 mg/kg/dose followed by a continuous infusion of 0.06 to 0.4 mg/kg/hour, maximum reported rate: 1.1 mg/kg/hour

-	**Procedural sedation:** Preterm and term neonates: IV: 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg/dose; additional doses may be administered if clinically indicated 

-	**Sedation, mechanically ventilated patient:** 
    + Loading dose: Limited data available: Note: Some recommend against the use of a loading or bolus dose in neonates to minimize risk of hypotension; to rapidly achieve sedation, it has been suggested to begin the continuous infusion at a faster rate for the first several hours
    + GA ≥24 weeks: IV: 0.05 to 0.2 mg/kg/dose once (administered over ≥1 hour to minimize risk of hypotension)
    + Continuous IV infusion: Note: Some experts do not recommend midazolam continuous IV infusions for sedation in preterm neonates; concerns exist regarding safety, specifically neurotoxicity
        + GA 24 to 26 weeks: IV: Initial: 0.015 to 0.03 mg/kg/hour (0.25 to 0.5 mcg/kg/minute) 
        + GA 27 to 29 weeks: IV: Initial: 0.015 to 0.04 mg/kg/hour (0.25 to 0.67 mcg/kg/minute) 
        + GA ≥30 weeks: IV: Initial: 0.015 to 0.06 mg/kg/hour (0.25 to 1 mcg/kg/minute) 

-	**Sedation tapering (after prolonged therapy):** 
    + If duration of therapy is ≤4 days: Taper over 1 to 2 days beginning with an initial dosage reduction of 30% to 50% followed by 20% to 30% dosage reductions every 6 to 8 hours as tolerated; monitor closely for signs and symptoms of withdrawal with each reduction in dose using a standardized withdrawal tool.
    + If duration of therapy is >4 days: Decrease infusion rate by 25% to 50% every 12 hours, then convert to an intermittent dose every 4 hours and lastly, every 8 hours as tolerated; monitor closely for signs and symptoms of withdrawal with each reduction in dose using a standardized withdrawal tool.
