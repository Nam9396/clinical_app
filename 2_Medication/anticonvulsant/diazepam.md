 
## Diazepam

### Preparation 
- Seduxen 2, 5, 10mg 
- Diazepam 5mg/1ml 


### General dosing

- **Maximum dosage**: 1 mg/kg, not to exceed a total dose of 5 mg in children  < 5 years or 10 mg in children ≥  5 years of age. Large doses given by continuous infusion may 
produce propylene glycol toxicity. Neonates should not receive doses larger than 1 mg/kg/hr 
because of benzyl alcohol toxicity  

-	**Seizures, acute**: Rectal solution: Undiluted 5 mg/mL parenteral formulation: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Reported dosing range: 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg/dose; may repeat dose; maximum dose: 20 mg/dose

-	**Status epilepticus:**
    + IV (preferred route):
    Infants >30 days, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg/dose slow IV; may repeat dose once in 5 minutes; maximum dose: 10 mg/dose.
    + Rectal: Note: For use when IV access unavailable.
        ++ Children 2 to <6 years: Rectal: 0.5 mg/kg; maximum dose: 20 mg/dose.
        ++ Children 6 to <12 years: Rectal: 0.3 mg/kg; maximum dose: 20 mg/dose.
        ++ Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: Rectal: 0.2 mg/kg; maximum dose: 20 mg/dose.

-	**Sedation, anxiolysis, and amnesia prior to procedure:**
    + Infants and Children: IV: Initial: 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg over 3 to 5 minutes, titrate slowly to effect (maximum total dose: 0.25 mg/kg)
    + Adolescents: IV: 5 mg; may repeat with 2.5 mg if needed


### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
No dosage adjustments necessary.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
Infants, Children, and Adolescents: There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling; based on adult experience and data, no dosage adjustment may be necessary for kidney impairment; use with caution, especially with prolonged courses; monitor closely; an increased incidence of CNS-related adverse effects has been reported in patients with hypoalbuminemia (which is frequently observed in patients with end-stage kidney disease or critical illness)

### Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to diazepam or any component of the formulation; acute narrow-angle glaucoma.
Injection: Additional contraindications: Untreated open-angle glaucoma.


### Warnings/Precautions
-	Anterograde amnesia: Benzodiazepines have been associated with anterograde amnesia 
-	CNS depression: May cause CNS depression, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks that require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery, driving).
-	Paradoxical reactions: Paradoxical reactions, including hyperactive or aggressive behavior, have been reported with benzodiazepines
-	Sleep-related activities: Hazardous sleep-related activities such as sleep-driving, cooking and eating food, and making phone calls while asleep have been noted with benzodiazepines
- Neonates and young infants have decreased metabolism of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam (active metabolite), both can accumulate with repeated use and cause increased toxicity.
Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; in neonates, large amounts of propylene glycol delivered orally, intravenously (eg, >3,000 mg/day), or topically have been associated with potentially fatal toxicities which can include metabolic acidosis, seizures, renal failure, and CNS depression; toxicities have also been reported in children and adults including hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution


### Administration
- Maximum concentration: 5 mg/mL for IV push
- Intermittent infusion: No information available
- IV push: 5 mg/mL over ≥ 3 minutes. Administer undiluted (5 mg/mL) direct IV; do not mix with other solutions or medications. Rapid injection may cause respiratory depression or hypotension; infants and children: Do not exceed 1 to 2 mg/minute IV push; adults: 5 mg/minute
- IM: Administer undiluted (5 mg/mL) deep into muscle mass.
- Continuous infusion: Midazolam  is the benzodiazepine of choice for continuous infusion. Rarely used 0.01 mg/kg/min increased by 0.005 mg/kg/min q 15 min to a maximum dosage of 0.03 mg/kg/min. Continuous infusion is not recommended because of precipitation in IV fluids, absorption of drug into infusion bags and tubing, and propylene glycol exposure
- Rectal: Injectable solution: If withdrawing dose from an ampule, use a filter needle. Administer as undiluted 5 mg/mL solution
- Suitable diluents D5W, LR, or NS

### Dosing for neonate
- Term and preterm infants greater than 28 days of age: 50 mg/kg/dose IV every 12 hours. 
- Term and preterm infants 28 days of age and younger: 30 mg/kg/dose IV every 12 hours. 
- Meningitis and severe infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Enterobacter spp: 50 mg/kg/dose IV every 12 hours.
