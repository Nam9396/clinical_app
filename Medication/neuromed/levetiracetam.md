 
## Levetiracetam

### Preparation 


### General dosing

- **Maximun dosage**: Loading dose of 70 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg/day up to 3 g/day

-	**Safety:** Avoid abrupt discontinuation of therapy to reduce risk of increased seizure frequency or status epilepticus.

-	**Seizure prophylaxis, traumatic brain injury: Note:** 
    + Current guidelines state that there is not sufficient evidence to recommend levetiracetam over phenytoin.
    
    + Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Limited data available, optimal dose not defined: IV, Oral (tablets, oral solution [eg, Keppra]): 20 to 55 mg/kg/day in divided doses twice daily; reported range: 5 to 55 mg/kg/day.

Another prospective observational study of patients with TBI at risk for seizures used a dose of 55 mg/kg/day in divided doses (n=20, ages 6 to 17 years); one patient developed seizures 7 days after initial trauma

-	**Status epilepticus, urgent therapy/second-phase therapy or refractory:**
    + American epilepsy society guidelines: Limited data available: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 60 mg/kg as a single dose; maximum dose: 4,500 mg/dose; initiate maintenance therapy based upon clinical response and type of seizure disorder.

### Contraindications
Hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylaxis, angioedema) to levetiracetam or any component of the formulation.

### Warnings/Precautions
-	CNS depression
    
    Levetiracetam may cause CNS depression (asthenia, ataxia [includes abnormal gait, incoordination], fatigue, dizziness, and somnolence [drowsiness]), which may impair physical or mental abilities. 

-	Hepatotoxicity  
    
    Levetiracetam-induced hepatotoxicity, including asymptomatic elevated transaminases, was reported in ~3% of levetiracetam adverse events reported between July 2018 and March 2020 to the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. Severe levetiracetam-induced hepatotoxicity requiring intervention is limited to case reports. Presentation of hepatotoxicity is broad and includes hepatocellular (eg, elevations in liver transaminases); cholestatic (eg, elevated bilirubin accompanied by symptomatic jaundice); or mixed with or without immunologic features (eg, fever, eosinophil infiltrate). Most cases resolved upon discontinuation; however, there are reports of liver transplantation and death.

-	Hypersensitivity reactions (delayed)

    Levetiracetam is associated with a variety of delayed hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild maculopapular rash. to severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. 

-	Psychiatric and behavioral abnormalities
    
    Psychotic symptoms, paranoid ideation, hallucinations, and behavioral changes (including aggressive behavior, agitation, outbursts of anger, anxiety, apathy, confusion, depersonalization, depression, emotional lability, hostility, dyskinesia, irritability, nervousness, neurosis, and personality disorder) may occur in adult and pediatric patients; dose reduction or discontinuation may be required. Suicidal ideation and suicidal tendencies have also been reported (Ref).


### Administration
