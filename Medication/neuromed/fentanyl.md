 
## Fentanyl

### Preparation 
Naloxone should be readily available to reverse adverse effects. Available in 2-, 5-, 10-, and 20-mL ampules in a concentration of 50 mcg/mL. A 10 mcg/mL dilution may be made by adding 1 mL of the 50-mcg/mL concentration to 4 mL preservative-free normal saline. Stable for 24 hours refrigerated.

### General dosing

- **Maximum dosage**: 75–150 mcg/kg/dose for general anesthesia

-	**Acute pain, severe (opioid-naive):**
    + Intermittent IV doses:
        -  Patient weight <50 kg: IV: Initial: 0.5 to 1 mcg/kg/dose; may repeat every 1 to 2 hours; more frequent dosing may be allowed (eg, every 30 minutes) if necessary; usual maximum dose: 50 mcg/dose; a higher maximum dose of 100 mcg/dose may be considered in critically ill patients in the ICU 
        - Patient weight ≥50 kg: Initial: IV: 25 to 50 mcg; repeat every 1 to 2 hours (more frequent dosing may be needed [eg, every 30 minutes]) 
    
    + Continuous IV infusion:
        - Patient weight <50 kg: Limited data available: Continuous IV infusion: Usual range: 0.5 to 2.5 mcg/kg/hour; initiate at the lower end and titrate to effect; an initial rate of 1 mcg/kg/hour has been suggested for critically ill patients in the ICU 
        - Patient weight ≥50 kg: Limited data available: Continuous IV infusion: Usual range: 25 to 100 mcg/hour; initiate at the lower end of dosage range and titrate to effect; an initial dose of 50 mcg/hour has been suggested for critically ill patients in the ICU 
-	**Anesthesia: Note:** Dosing presented reflects general ranges; specific dose dependent on patient characteristics, procedure, and/or other anesthetic agents employed.
    + Induction and maintenance: Children 2 to 12 years: IV: 2 to 10 mcg/kg/dose; followed by a continuous infusion in some cases at 2 to 5 mcg/kg/hour 
    
    + Anesthesia, general; adjunct: Note: Specific dose dependent on type of procedure/surgery and other anesthetics in use. Dosing provided is a general range and dose should be individualized. Specific maintenance and total dosages should be based on intraoperative clinical response managed by clinicians trained in anesthesia: Adolescents: IV: 0.5 to 50 mcg/kg/dose.

-	**Pain and sedation, patients who are critically ill (ICU):**
    + Infants and Children: Limited data available in <2 years of age: 
        - Initial IV bolus: 1 to 2 mcg/kg followed by
        - Continuous IV infusion at initial rate: 1 mcg/kg/hour; titrate to effect; usual range: 1 to 3 mcg/kg/hour; some patients may require higher rates (5 mcg/kg/hour) 

    + Adolescents:
        - Patient weight ≤50 kg: Initial IV bolus: 0.5 to 2 mcg/kg followed by continuous IV infusion at initial rate: 0.5 to 2 mcg/kg/hour based on expert recommendations for children and pediatric patients ≤50 kg 
    
        -  Patient weight >50 kg: Initial IV bolus: 25 to 100 mcg/dose followed by continuous IV infusion at initial rate: 25 to 200 mcg/hour based on expert recommendations for pediatric patients and experience in adult patients 

-	**Rapid sequence intubation, pretreatment:** Infants and Children: IV: 1 mcg/kg/dose; may repeat every 3 minutes; maximum dose: 50 mcg/dose

### Warnings/Precautions
-	Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is the most common subtype of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD), which is a broader term that encompasses additional GI opioid-induced adverse reactions including nausea, vomiting, and gastroesophageal reflux. Tolerance does not develop to OIC. Constipation due to fentanyl may decrease quality of life, contribute to nonadherence, and result in treatment failure. Transdermal fentanyl may cause less constipation than oral opioids (eg, oxycodone, morphine). Fentanyl may cause less constipation than morphine in critically ill children.
-	Serious, life-threatening, or fatal opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) may occur with use of fentanyl. Fentanyl may be particularly hazardous secondary to potency, faster onset of action, and lower cross tolerance.
-	Abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction in patients who are physically dependent (ie, have opioid dependence) to opioids has been associated with a serious opioid-induced withdrawal syndrome (OIW), uncontrolled pain, attempts to find other opioids (including illicit), and suicide in all ages. Concurrent use of mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol) or partial agonist (eg, buprenorphine) analgesics may also precipitate withdrawal symptoms and/or reduced analgesic efficacy in patients following prolonged therapy with mu opioid agonists. Reversal of analgesia, irritability, nausea, and vomiting, abdominal cramping, tachycardia, restlessness, and sweating are common symptoms. Symptoms typically dissipate over 4 to 7 days and fully resolve within 14 days; may cause significant distress but are rarely life-threatening 



### Administration
- Maximum concentration: 50 mcg/mL

- Intermittent infusion: 10–50 mcg/mL.(4,18) Usually given IV push (slow) or continuously. The ISMP and Vermont Oxford Network recommend a standard concentration of 10 mcg/mL for neonates.

- IV push: 10–50 mcg/mL. Over 3–5 minutes to reduce incidence of chest wall rigidity or respiratory depression; over 1–3 minutes if given concurrently with a neuromuscular blocking agent during or in preparation for intubation/mechanical ventilation. The ISMP and Vermont Oxford Network recommend a standard concentration of 10 mcg/mL for neonates

- Continuous infusion: 10–50 mcg/mL.(4, 18) May be given by continuous IV infusion.(20,38,41,42,54) The ISMP and Vermont Oxford Network recommend a standard concentration of 10 mcg/mL for neonates.(53) Has been given as a continuous SC infusion in children weaning from prolonged sedation

- Suitable diluents D5W, NS

-	Neonates: Administer as a continuous infusion via an infusion pump or by slow IV push over 3 to 5 minutes. Larger bolus doses (>5 mcg/kg) should be administered over 5 to 10 minutes; may also administer intermittent doses via syringe pump over 15 to 30 minutes . Risk of chest wall rigidity is minimized when doses are administered over at least 1 to 2 minutes .

-	Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Administer by slow IV push over 3 to 5 minutes or by continuous infusion via an infusion pump. Larger bolus doses (>5 mcg/kg) should be given by slow IV push over 5 to 10 minutes.


### Dosing for neonate
- Sedation and Analgesia: 0.5 to 4 mcg/kg per dose IV slow push. Repeat as required (usually every 2 to 4 hours). 

- Infusion rate: 1 to 5 mcg/kg per hour. Tolerance may develop rapidly following constant infusion. Anesthesia: 5 to 50 mcg/kg per dose.

- Respiratory depression occurs when anesthetic doses (greater than 5 mcg/kg) are used and may also occur unexpectedly because of redistribution. Chest wall rigidity has occurred in 4% of neonates who received 2.2 to 6.5 mcg/kg per dose, occasionally associated with laryngospasm. This was reversible with administration of naloxone. Urinary retention may occur when using continuous infusions. Tolerance may develop to analgesic doses with prolonged use. Significant withdrawal symptoms have been reported in patients treated with continuous infusion for 5 days or longer.
