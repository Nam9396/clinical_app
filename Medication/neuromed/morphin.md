### Preparation 
Injectable solutions are available in dosage strengths ranging from 0.5 to 50 mg/mL. Oral morphine sulfate solutions are available in concentrations of 2 and 4 mg/mL. A 0.4-mg/mL oral morphine dilution may be made by adding 1 mL of the 4-mg/mL injectable solution to 9 mL preservative-free normal saline. Stable for 7 days refrigerated. Protect from light.


### General dosing

- **Maximum dosage**: 0.2 mg/kg/dose up to 10 mg/dose or 15 mg/dose

-	**Acute pain, severe (opioid-naive patients):**
    + Note: Repeated SUBQ administration may cause local tissue irritation, pain, and induration. The use of IM injections is no longer recommended, especially for repeated administration due to painful administration, variable absorption, and lag time to peak effect; other routes are more reliable and less painful
    
    + Infants ≤6 months:
        - Note: Infants <3 months are more susceptible to respiratory depression and cardiovascular adverse effects; use extra caution and consider frequent or continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring and administer in a setting that permits rapid management of respiratory insufficiency
    
        - Intermittent dosing: Infants ≤6 months: IV or SUBQ: Initial: 0.025 to 0.05 mg/kg/dose every 2 to 4 hours (Ref).

        - Continuous IV infusion: Infants ≤6 months: Initial: 0.008 to 0.02 mg/kg/hour (8 to 20 mcg/kg/hour); titrate carefully to effect. Higher initial doses of 0.05 mg/kg/hour (50 mcg/kg/hour) have been recommended in critically ill patients in the ICU 

    + Infants >6 months, Children, and Adolescents:
        - Intermittent dosing: IV, SUBQ: Infants >6 months, Children, and Adolescents:
            - Weight <50 kg: IV, SUBQ: Initial: 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg/dose every 2 to 4 hours; titrate based on patient response 
            
            - Weight ≥50 kg: IV, SUBQ: Initial: 2 to 5 mg every 2 to 4 hours as needed. Use lower end of the dosing range in opioid naive patients; higher doses have been recommended (5 to 8 mg every 2 to 4 hours as needed) 
        - Continuous IV infusion, SUBQ continuous infusion: Note: Patients should have continuous respiratory monitoring (eg, pulse oximetry) and be in a setting that permits rapid management of respiratory insufficiency

- Tapering after prolonged therapy (ie, physical dependence): Note: Do not discontinue morphine abruptly; optimal taper schedule not established; individualize taper based on patient response; use of a withdrawal assessment tool is recommended; manufacturer labeling recommends:
    - Continuous IV infusion: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Decrease dose by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days; monitor closely for signs and symptoms of withdrawal with each reduction in dose.
    
    - Oral solution: Children ≥2 years and Adolescents: Decrease dose by no greater than 10% to 25% of total daily dose every 2 to 4 weeks; monitor closely for signs and symptoms of withdrawal with each reduction in dose. Patients who have been taking opioids for short periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.

- **Tetralogy of fallot, hypercyanotic spell (infundibular spasm):** Limited data available:
Infants and Children:
    -  IV: 0.1 mg/kg as a single dose 
    - IM: 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg as a single dose 
    - SUBQ: 0.2 mg/kg as a single dose 


### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
Infants, Children and Adolescents: There are no dosage adjustments provided in manufacturer's labeling. Pharmacokinetics are unchanged in mild liver disease; substantial extrahepatic metabolism may occur. In patients with cirrhosis, the manufacturers recommend starting cautiously with lower doses, titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for adverse effects.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
Infants, Children and Adolescents: There are no specific dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling. In general, the manufacturers recommend starting cautiously with lower doses, titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects. However, the choice of an alternate opioid may be prudent in patients with baseline renal impairment or rapidly changing renal function especially since other analgesics may be safer and reduced initial morphine dosing may result in suboptimal analgesia. Although clearance of morphine is similar to patients with normal renal function, morphine glucuronide metabolites (M3G [inactive as an analgesic; may contribute to CNS stimulation] and M6G [active analgesic]) accumulate in renal impairment resulting in increased sensitivity; patients may experience severe and prolonged respiratory depression which may even be delayed 

- CrCl 10–50 mL/min/1.73 m2: 75% of the usual dose
- CrCl 10 mL/min/1.73 m2: 50% of the usual dose


### Contraindications
Hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylaxis) to morphine or any component of the formulation; significant respiratory depression; acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment; concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or use of MAOIs within the last 14 days; GI obstruction, including paralytic ileus (known or suspected).
Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information


### Warnings/Precautions
-	Opioid-induced constipation: Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is the most common subtype of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD), which is a broader term that encompasses additional GI opioid-induced adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting, and gastroesophageal reflux. Symptoms of OIC may include decreased frequency of bowel movements, straining to pass bowel movements, a sense of incomplete evacuation, and/or hard stools. Tolerance does not develop to OIC. Symptoms are reversible after discontinuation of the opioid. OIC is the most common reason for discontinuation reported by patients and may often result in a longer hospital stay and increased overall healthcare costs. Opioid dose or route of administration do not appear to alter risk.

-	Opioid-induced neurotoxicity: Opioid-induced neurotoxicity is an opioid-related adverse drug reaction more commonly associated with opioids that have active metabolites (eg, codeine, hydromorphone, meperidine, morphine, oxycodone). Symptoms may include allodynia, delirium, hallucinations, hyperalgesia, hypersomnolence, myoclonus, tremor, and seizures.

-	Opioid-induced pruritus: Reversible peripherally- and/or centrally-mediated opioid-induced pruritus (OIP) may occur with systemic or neuraxial (ie, epidural or intrathecal) opioid administration though, it is most common with neuraxial delivery.

-	Opioid-induced respiratory depression: Serious, life-threatening, or fatal opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) may occur with use of morphine in adult and pediatric patients. Effects include hypoventilation, hypoxia, hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis, as well as reduced ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia.

-	Opioid-induced withdrawal: Abruptly stopping or reducing opioid use in patients with physical dependence on opioids can precipitate opioid-induced withdrawal (OIW) in adult and pediatric patients. Physical symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, tachycardia, chills, muscle aches, bone pain, agitation, anxiety, and insomnia. The presence and severity of withdrawal symptoms are associated with an increased risk of nonfatal overdose and receptive syringe sharing in people who inject drugs. Avoidance of withdrawal symptoms may drive continued opioid use. Symptoms typically dissipate over 4 to 7 days 

**Disease-related concerns**
- Abdominal conditions: May obscure diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.
- Adrenocortical insufficiency: Use with caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency, including Addison disease. Long-term opioid use may cause secondary hypogonadism, which may lead to sexual dysfunction, infertility, mood disorders, and osteoporosis (Brennan 2013).
- Biliary tract impairment: Use with caution in patients with biliary tract dysfunction or acute pancreatitis; opioids may cause constriction of sphincter of Oddi.
- Cardiovascular conditions: Morphine may cause constipation, which may be problematic in patients with unstable angina and patients post–myocardial infarction.
- CNS depression/coma: Avoid use in patients with impaired consciousness or coma, as these patients are susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention.
- Delirium tremens: Use with caution in patients with delirium tremens. Some dosage forms may be contraindicated in patients with delirium tremens.
- Head trauma: Use with extreme caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or elevated intracranial pressure (ICP); exaggerated elevation of ICP may occur. Some dosage forms may be contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial or cerebrospinal pressure, head injuries, or brain tumor.
- Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
- Mental health conditions: Use opioids with caution for chronic pain in patients with mental health conditions (eg, depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder) due to potential increased risk for opioid use disorder and overdose; more frequent monitoring is recommended 
- Obesity: Use with caution in patients who are morbidly obese.
- Psychosis: Use with caution in patients with toxic psychosis.
- Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment.
- Respiratory disease: Use with caution and monitor for respiratory depression in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercarbia, or preexisting respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating therapy; critical respiratory depression may occur, even at therapeutic dosages. Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients.
- Seizure disorders: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders; may cause or exacerbate preexisting seizures. Some dosage forms may be contraindicated in patients with seizure disorder.
- Thyroid dysfunction: Use with caution in patients with thyroid dysfunction
