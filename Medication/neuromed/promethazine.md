 
## Promethazine

### Preparation 


### General dosing

-	**Safety:** Use with extreme caution and utilize the lowest effective dose to reduce the risk of adverse effects with all routes of administration. Use has generally been replaced by agents that are more effective with fewer adverse events. Due to risk of severe tissue injury, IV and IM administration is generally avoided.

-	**Nausea and vomiting**
    + Note: Promethazine has been used as an antiemetic for various presenting conditions (eg, postoperative nausea/vomiting, chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting, cyclic vomiting syndrome, migraine). In most clinical situations, routine use has been replaced by alternate agents from other therapeutic classes; however, promethazine may be necessary in refractory situations or as rescue therapy; may consider concomitant diphenhydramine to decrease risk of dystonic adverse effects
    
    + Children ≥2 years and Adolescents: Oral, IM, IV, rectal: Usual range: 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg/dose every 4 to 6 hours as needed; doses up to 1.1 mg/kg/dose may be necessary in some patients; do not exceed usual adult dose of 6.25 to 25 mg/dose 

-	**Preprocedure sedation, adjunct:** Children ≥2 years and Adolescents: Oral, IM, IV: 0.5 to 1.1 mg/kg once 30 minutes prior to procedure as part of an appropriate combination regimen; maximum dose: 12.5 to 25 mg/dose; manufacturer recommends in combination with a reduced dose of opioid or barbiturate and an appropriate dosage of an atropine-like drug if appropriate; however, other combination regimens have been described 


### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
Children ≥ 2 years and Adolescents: The manufacturer recommends to avoid use in pediatric patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic disease (extrapyramidal symptoms caused by promethazine may be confused with CNS signs of hepatic disease).

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
Children ≥2 years and Adolescents: There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling.

### Contraindications
- Promethazine is contraindicated in pediatric patients <2 years of age because of the
potential for fatal respiratory depression. Postmarketing cases of respiratory depression,
including fatalities, have been reported with promethazine use in patients <2 years of
age. A wide range of weight-based doses have resulted in respiratory depression in these
patients.
- Caution should be exercised when administering promethazine to pediatric patients
>2 years of age. Use the lowest effective dose and avoid the use of concomitant therapy
with respiratory depressants.


### Warnings/Precautions

-	Anticholinergic effects
Phenothiazines, including promethazine, may cause anticholinergic adverse effects such as blurred vision, confusion, constipation, dry eye, urinary retention, and xerostomia. Promethazine is included in the Beers Criteria of Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults 
-	CNS depression
Promethazine use has been associated with dizziness, drowsiness, delirium, motor dysfunction (motor sensory instability), and sedated state in adult (including pregnant women) and pediatric patients. Promethazine is included in the Beers Criteria of Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults 
-	Extrapyramidal reactions (EPS), including akathisia, acute dystonia, drug-induced parkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia, have occurred with the use of promethazine and other dopamine receptor antagonist neuroleptic agents in adult and pediatric patients. Symptoms of EPS may be confused with other conditions, such as Reye syndrome or other encephalopathy. Acute akathisia is typically transient and resolves with drug discontinuation, but delayed akathisia may be permanent. Resolution of acute dystonia occurs quickly after drug discontinuation and with supportive care. Symptoms of drug-induced parkinsonism typically resolve within 7 months of drug discontinuation but may persist for 18 months or longer. The use of dopamine receptor antagonists, such as promethazine, may unmask undiagnosed idiopathic Parkinson disease. Tardive dyskinesia may be irreversible; earlier drug discontinuation increases the likelihood of symptom resolution.

-	Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been associated with the use of dopamine receptor antagonist neuroleptics, including promethazine. Recovery generally occurs after drug discontinuation and with supportive care; however, some cases have been fatal. Cases with promethazine have been reported following single doses, alone or in combination with other medications and has occurred in patients who have previously received promethazine without incident. Resolution onset has occurred 5 to 7 days after diagnosis .

-	Orthostatic hypotension
Phenothiazines, including promethazine, may cause orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension may increase the risk for falls in older patients; this risk may be augmented by the sedative effects of promethazine.
-	Respiratory depression
Rare but fatal respiratory depression in neonates and children may occur. An FDA black box warning exists for children <2 years of age; however, it may occur in adults, especially patients with compromised respiratory function 



### Administration
- Oral: Measure and administer prescribed dose of oral solution using dosing syringe, dosing spoon, or dosing cup.
- Parenteral: Note: The Institute for Safe Medication Practices recommends against the use of injectable promethazine (any route) due to the risk of severe tissue damag


### Mechanism of Action
Phenothiazine derivative; blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic receptors in the brain; exhibits a strong alpha-adrenergic blocking effect and depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones; competes with histamine for the H1-receptor; muscarinic-blocking effect may be responsible for antiemetic activity; reduces stimuli to the brainstem reticular system
