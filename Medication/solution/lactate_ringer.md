### Warnings/Precautions
- Alkalosis: Use with caution in patients with alkalosis or at risk for alkalosis. Lactate is metabolized to bicarbonate and could worsen metabolic alkalosis.

- Fluid overload: Use with extreme caution, if at all, in patients with hypervolemia, overhydration, edema, or conditions that may cause sodium and/or fluid overload.
- Heart failure: Use with caution in patients with heart failure.
- Hepatic impairment: Use with extreme caution in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency because of impaired lactate metabolism.

- Kidney impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe renal insufficiency.


### Administration
- Injection: Should not be administered simultaneously with citrate anticoagulated/preserved blood through the same administration set because of the likelihood of coagulation.
