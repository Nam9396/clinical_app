 
## Natriclorua


### Preparation 


### Dosing: Neonatal
Note: Consider all sources of sodium when calculating patient needs; daily maintenance sodium requirements can be met with a combination or enteral and parenteral sources (eg, enteral formulas, IV solutions, parenteral nutrition). Premature and term neonates: Oral, IV: 2 to 5 mEq/kg/day

-	**Hyponatremia, treatment** (eg, hypovolemic hyponatremia, hyponatremia secondary to sodium and water loss): IV: 0.9% isotonic solution:
    + Dose (mEq sodium) = [desired serum sodium (mEq/L) – actual serum sodium (mEq/L)] x TBW/100 x wt (kg)
    + TBW: Total Body Water:
    + Premature infants: 80%.
    + Infants ≤3 months: 70%.
    + Sodium replacement: No more than 50% of sodium deficit should be replaced over 12 hours. Maximum correction rate: 0.4 to 0.5 mEq/L/hour.

-	**Volume expansion, resuscitation:** 0.9% isotonic solution: IV: 10 mL/kg; may repeat

-	**Nasal dryness/congestion:** Intranasal solution: Note: Consult product-specific labeling for approved use in neonates; Intranasal: 2 to 6 drops per nostril as needed; product concentrations vary; most are a 0.65% to 0.9% solution.

### Dosing: Pediatric
- **Note:** Systemic hypertonic solutions (>0.9%) should only be used for the initial treatment of acute serious symptomatic hyponatremia or increased intracranial pressure.

-	**Normal daily maintenance sodium requirements:**
    + Infants and Children ≤50 kg: Oral, IV: 2 to 5 mEq/kg/day.
    + Children >50 kg and Adolescents: Oral, IV: 1 to 2 mEq/kg/day.

-	**Hyponatremia:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: Note: The choice of saline preparation (eg, 0.9% isotonic solution or 3% hypertonic solution) is based on the presence and severity of symptoms. The use of 3% hypertonic solution is generally limited to symptomatic patients (severe hyponatremia) with neurologic findings (eg, seizures, altered mental status) 

    + **Symptomatic (severe hyponatremia with severe neurologic symptoms):** Limited data available; variable regimens reported: 3% hypertonic solution: Bolus IV infusion: 2 to 5 mL/kg over 20 minutes (maximum dose: 150 mL/dose); monitor serum sodium 20 minutes after dose. If necessary, may repeat up to 2 times if severe symptoms continue. Alternatively, dosing can be based on the estimation of the sodium deficit* needed to correct the serum sodium by 4 to 6 mEq/L in the initial 1 to 4 hours of symptom onset. Maximum correction rate: 0.5 mEq/L/hour or 10 mEq/L/24 hours. In cases in which the onset of hyponatremia has been sudden (<24 hours), the rate of correction can match the rate of onset without an mEq/L/hour limit. Note: Continuous infusion of hypertonic saline may be considered, consult institutional policy.

    + **Asymptomatic or mild to moderate symptoms (mild to moderate hyponatremia):** Limited data available: Note: Dosing based on estimation of the sodium deficit* with replacement using 0.9 % isotonic solution over 24 to 48 hours. In general, no more than 50% of sodium deficit should be replaced over 12 hours. Maximum correction rate: 8 mEq/24 hours (chronic hyponatremia duration >48 hours) or 10 mEq/24 hours (acute hyponatremia duration <48 hours) 
    
    + Sodium deficit (mEq sodium) = [desired serum sodium (mEq/L) - actual serum sodium (mEq/L)] x 0.6 x wt (kg)

-	**Hypovolemic shock:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 0.9% isotonic solution: 20 mL/kg/dose; may repeat until blood pressure and markers of cardiac output (eg, capillary refill, heart rate, peripheral pulses) improve or until signs of fluid overload occur; usual requirement is 40 to 60 mL/kg

-	**Septic shock:** Limited data available: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 0.9% isotonic solution: 10 to 20 mL/kg/dose; maximum dose: 1,000 mL/dose; repeat every 15 minutes for up to 4 hours 

-	**Cerebral edema, diabetic ketoacidosis:** Limited data available: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: 3% hypertonic solution: IV: 2.5 to 5 mL/kg administered over 10 to 15 minutes, can be used as an alternative to mannitol or in those unresponsive to mannitol

-	**Increased intracranial pressure (ICP), traumatic brain injury (TBI):**
Note: Monitor sodium concentration closely, avoid sustained (>72 hours) serum sodium concentrations >170 mEq/L to avoid thrombocytopenia and anemia and avoid serum sodium concentrations >160 mEq/L to avoid deep vein thrombosis
Bolus: Limited data available; dosing regimens variable: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: 3% hypertonic solution: IV: 2 to 5 mL/kg administered over 10 to 20 minutes 
Continuous IV infusion: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: 3% hypertonic solution: IV infusion: 0.1 to 1 mL/kg/hour titrated to maintain ICP <20 mm Hg; monitor serum sodium concentration closely.

-	**Bronchiolitis, viral (mild to moderate, inpatient):**
Note: Current bronchiolitis guidelines do not recommend hypertonic saline to treat infants in the emergency department; however, it may be administered to hospitalized infants and children.
Infants and Children <18 months: Limited data available, efficacy results variable, optimal dose not defined: Inhalation: 3% solution: 4 mL inhaled every 2 hours for 3 doses followed by every 4 hours for 5 doses and continued every 6 hours until discharge. Other trials using doses of 2 to 4 mL every 6 hours have shown no benefit.


### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
No dosage adjustments necessary.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
Dosage adjustments necessary if GFR < 60

### Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to sodium chloride or any component of the formulation; hypernatremia and/or fluid retention (dosage form specific).

### Warnings/Precautions
-	Extravasation: Concentrated solutions of IV sodium chloride (>1%) are irritants (with vesicant-like properties at higher osmolarities); depends on osmolarity; higher osmolarity is associated with a higher risk. Ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during infusion. Avoid extravasation.

-	Hemolysis: The use of hypotonic saline solutions (eg, sodium chloride 0.225%) may result in hemolysis if administered rapidly and for prolonged periods. If hypotonic saline solutions become necessary, administration as D5W/NaCl 0.2% or NaCl 0.45% is recommended for most patients (eg, those without hyperglycemia).

- In neonates, maximum serum concentration correction rate should generally not exceed 10 mEq/L/day; in infants, children, adolescents, and adults, do not exceed a maximum serum concentration correction rate of 12 mEq/L/day. Administration of low sodium or sodium free IV solutions may result in significant hyponatremia or water intoxication in pediatric patients; monitor serum sodium concentration.


### Administration
- Maximum concentration 280 mg/mL for IM and 160 mg/mL for IV administration. 
- Intermittent infusion 10 – 40 mg/mL over 30 minutes.
- IV push Although not generally administered by this method, doses of 2 g have been given over 3 – 5 minutes in adults 
- Suitable diluents D5W, D10W, NS, D5NS, D5LR, Normosol-M in D5, or Normosol – R in D5

-	0.9% isotonic solution: Hypotension, shock:
+ Neonates: Published data not available; consider slower administration to avoid IVH
+ Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Administer boluses by IV push or via rapid infusion device
- 3% hypertonic solution:
+ >2% solutions: Administration through a central venous line is recommended due to high osmolarity and tonicity. In the absence of a central line and when urgent administration is necessary, 3% solutions may be safely administered through a peripheral venous line. 
+ Cerebral edema, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Bolus doses typically administered over 10 to 15 minutes. Longer infusions of 30 minutes have also been described in patients DKA.
+ Increased intracranial pressure (ICP), traumatic brain injury (TBI): Bolus doses typically administered over 10 to 20 minutes
+ Symptomatic hyponatremia, severe: Bolus doses typically administered over 20 minutes

### Role of Natriclorua 3% in ICP 
Hypertonic saline — There is limited evidence to compare hypertonic saline with mannitol for the treatment of intracranial hypertension. Hypertonic saline is preferred by many experts for the treatment of severe TBIs. Hypertonic saline does not cause osmotic diuresis, may reduce elevated ICP to a greater degree, and can be administered as a continuous infusion. (See 'Choice of agent' above.)
We use the following dosing regimen for hypertonic saline:
- Initial IV bolus of 5 mL/kg of 3 percent saline which corresponds to an expected rise in serum sodium of 5 mEq/L; this dose may be repeated, hourly, as needed until the serum sodium reaches 160 mEq/L. Hypertonic saline typically fails to further reduce ICP when the serum sodium exceeds 160 mEq/L. Although differing concentrations of hypertonic saline ranging from 3 to 29 percent have been used in adults and children 

- Continuous infusion of 3 percent saline at rates of 0.5 to 1.5 mL/kg per hour adjusted to maintain ICP <20 mmHg may also be used after the ICP is controlled by hypertonic saline boluses.
IV hypertonic saline, alone or in combination with dextran or hydroxyethyl starch, has been shown to decrease ICP and increase CPP in adult and pediatric patients with elevated ICP. It is thought to act by establishing an osmotic gradient that reduces brain water content and appears to maintain efficacy with repeat dosing even in patients who have stopped responding to mannitol. In addition, based upon observational data, hypertonic saline appears to be superior to pentobarbital and fentanyl for treatment of acute elevations of ICP. As an example, in a prospective observational study that evaluated cerebral hemodynamic effects of hypertonic saline, pentobarbital, and fentanyl, administration of hypertonic saline was associated with the fastest decreased in ICP with an increase in CPP.
Unlike mannitol, 3 percent hypertonic saline does not cause profound osmotic diuresis, and the risk of hypovolemia as a complication is decreased. 

Additional proposed benefits include:
- Restoration of normal cellular resting membrane potential and cell volume,
- Stimulation of atrial natriuretic peptide release,
- Inhibition of inflammation, and
- Enhancement of cardiac output.

Rebound increased ICP has occurred after 3 percent hypertonic saline administration. Other potential complications associated with hypertonic saline administration include hypernatremia and hyperosmolality with acute kidney injury, fluid overload with pulmonary edema and/or heart failure, metabolic acidosis, and osmotic demyelination syndrome (formerly called central pontine myelinolysis).
