 
## Mannitol 

### Preparation 
- Tên chế phẩm: Osmofundin 20%
- Hàm lượng thường gặp: Osmofundin 20%
- Dược động: khởi phát tác dụng sau 5 phút, đỉnh sau 30 phút và kéo dài 2 – 6 giờ


### General dosing
- **Tính nhanh:** lấy 2.5 x kg ra số ml mannitol 20% để đạt liều 0.5g/kg/liều

- **Maximum dosage**: 2.5 g/kg has been used in adults. However, there does not appear to be a therapeutic
advantage to doses >1 g/kg

-	**Intracranial pressure (ICP) reduction:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: Usual range: 0.25 to 1 g/kg/dose infused over 20 to 30 minutes; repeat as needed to maintain serum osmolality <320 mOsm/kg

-	**Intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 1.5 to 2 g/kg/dose infused over ≥30 minutes. Note: When used preoperatively, administer 60 to 90 minutes prior to surgery.

- **Acute renal failure (oliguria)**
    + Assessment of renal function: The manufacturer recommends that patients with marked oliguria or suspected renal insuffciency be given a test dose before beginning IV mannitol therapy.
    + 0.2 g/kg to a maximum of 12.5 g over 3–5 minutes to produce a urine output of≥1 mL/kg/hr or 30–50 mL/hr in adults for 1–3 hours. This may be repeated after 2 hours if the response is inadequate.
    + Treatment: 0.25–2 g/kg/dose over 2–6 hours. Should not be repeated if oliguria persists. Mannitol is not recommended for the prevention of acute renal failure


### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
No dosage adjustments necessary.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling for kidney impairment. Use with caution in patients with underlying renal disease, with conditions that put them at high risk for developing kidney failure, or receiving potentially nephrotoxic drugs. Use is contraindicated in patients with anuria.

### Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to mannitol or any component of the formulation
- Anuria
- Severe hypovolemia
- Active intracranial bleeding except during craniotomy
- Preexisting severe pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.

### Warnings/Precautions
-	Extravasation: Vesicant (at concentrations >5%); ensure proper catheter or needle position prior to and during IV infusion. Avoid extravasation of IV infusions; may cause compartment syndrome. Administration into a large central vein is recommended.

-	Fluid/electrolyte imbalance: May cause hypervolemia and electrolyte disturbances; monitor for new onset or worsening cardiac or pulmonary congestion. Also may cause profound diuresis with fluid and electrolyte loss; close medical supervision and dose evaluation are required. Correct electrolyte disturbances; adjust dose to avoid dehydration.

-	Hypersensitivity: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis), including fatalities, have been reported. Discontinue mannitol immediately if hypersensitivity reaction develops and treat accordingly.

-	Nephrotoxicity: May cause kidney dysfunction, especially with high doses; use caution in patients taking other nephrotoxic agents, with sepsis, or preexisting kidney disease. To minimize adverse kidney effects, monitor serum osmolality or osmolar gap (NCCS [Cook 2020]). Discontinue mannitol if acute kidney injury develops.

- Mannitol may increase cerebral blood flow, increase the risk of postoperative bleeding in neurosurgical patients, and worsen intracranial hypertension in children who develop generalized cerebral hyperemia during the first 24 to 48 hours after traumatic brain injury

### Disease-related concerns
- Administration: Do not administer mannitol solutions simultaneously with blood due to the possibility of pseudoagglutination or hemolysis.

- Cardiac and pulmonary: Mannitol may initially worsen pulmonary edema or heart failure by causing hypervolemia before diuresis ensues. Do not administer large volumes of mannitol to patients with preexisting severe pulmonary edema or heart failure. Discontinue mannitol if cardiac or pulmonary status worsens.

- Cerebral edema: In patients being treated for cerebral edema, mannitol may accumulate in the brain (causing rebound increases in intracranial pressure) if circulating for long periods of time as with continuous infusion; intermittent boluses preferred. If hypotension occurs, monitor cerebral perfusion pressure; reassess dose and mannitol therapy if there is a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure.

- CNS effects: CNS toxicity (eg, coma, confusion, lethargy) may occur; risk may be increased in patients with impaired kidney function or with concomitant use of neurotoxic drugs. Discontinue mannitol if CNS toxicity develops.

- Kidney impairment: Use with caution. In patients with severe impairment; do not use until adequacy of kidney function and urine flow is established.

### Mechanism of Action
Produces an osmotic diuresis by increasing the osmotic pressure of glomerular filtrate, which inhibits tubular reabsorption of water and electrolytes and increases urinary output . Mechanism of action in reduction of intracranial pressure (ICP) is less clear. However, it is thought that mannitol reduces ICP by reducing blood viscosity which transiently increases cerebral blood flow and oxygen transport and constricts pial arterioles. This in turn reduces cerebral blood volume and ICP. Furthermore, mannitol reduces ICP by withdrawing water from the brain parenchyma and excretes water in the urine (Allen 1998; BTF [Carney 2017]).

### Administration
- Maximum concentration: 25% solution
- Intermittent infusion: Intermittent infusion Over 15–60 minutes for cerebral edema, elevated ICP, or preoperative in neurosurgery (Prefer)
- IV push: IV push 3–5 minutes in oliguria. Rapid administration can cause hypotension, hyperosmolality, and elevations in intracranial
pressure (ICP)
- Continuous infusion: Not recommended
- Suitable diluents D5W (?!)
- There is little information on the repeated, regular use of mannitol over several days


- The recommended initial dose for mannitol is 0.5 to 1 g/kg (2.5 to 5 mL/kg of the 20 percent solution which contains 200 mg/mL mannitol concentration) given as an IV infusion through an in-line filter over 20 to 30 minutes. Mannitol should never be run as a continuous infusion.
- The higher dose is preferred in patients with acute herniation or severe head trauma. Although there is no maximum dose for mannitol, the 20 percent solution is typically supplied in a volume of 500 mL or 250 mL. We typically do not exceed one full 500 mL bag which is equivalent to a 1 g/kg dose for a 100 kg patient.
- In other patients, starting with the lower dose is recommended, because there is no proven benefit to the higher dose 
- Mannitol causes a brisk diuresis. For this reason, all patients receiving mannitol should have a Foley catheter placed to prevent bladder overdistension and to monitor urine output
- Mannitol has a rapid onset of action and maintains its effect for a period of 1.5 to 6 hours. Settings in which mannitol can be used to decrease ICP and improve CPP include acute herniation, acute elevation of ICP, and ICP elevation that does not respond to other therapies.
- Thực tế thường dùng trong 5 ngày (?!)
