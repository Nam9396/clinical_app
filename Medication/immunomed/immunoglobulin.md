 
## Immunoglobulin (IVIG)

### Preparation 
Hãy chú ý nồng độ chế phẩm IVIG, cần chỉ định đúng loại chế phẩm, mỗi chế phầm có nồng độ khác nhau, ví dụ: 
- Kiovig 2.5g/25ml  (100mg/ml)
- Octapharma 2.5g/50ml

### General dosing

- **Maximun dosage**: Typically 2 g/kg(17) but up to 5.8 g/kg has been reported

- **Safety:** Not all products are interchangeable with regards to route of administration; consult manufacturers' labeling for additional information. Consider osmolarity and concentration during product selection; infuse as slowly as indication and stability allow (consult "Immune Globulin Product Comparison" for additional details). Dosage expressed as mg/kg or mL/kg dependent upon route of administration; use extra caution to ensure accuracy.

- **Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) Treatment Protocol**
    + Standard dosage for all grades: 1 g/kg/dose
    + Grade 2b, Group 1:  Routine IVIG is not indicated.
        - Administer only if neurological symptoms do not subside after 6 hours of Phenobarbital treatment. 
        - Reassess after 24 hours to determine the necessity of a second dose.
    + Grade 2b, Group 2: Routine IVIG is indicated.
        - Reassess after 24 hours to determine the necessity of a second dose.
    + Grade 3: Routine IVIG is indicated.
        - Dosage: 1 dose per day for 2 consecutive days.

-	**Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM):** Children and Adolescents: IV: 1,000 mg/kg/dose once daily for 2 days

-	**Colitis due to Clostridioides difficile, chronic:** Infants and Children: IV: 400 mg/kg/dose every 3 weeks resulted in resolution of colitis symptoms during treatment; duration of therapy was unclear (n=5; age range: 6 to 37 months)

-	**Dermatomyositis, refractory:** Children: IV: 1,000 mg/kg/dose once daily for 2 days; Note: If maintenance therapy is required, the dose and frequency should be based on clinical response and doses should not exceed 2,000 mg/kg per treatment course

-	**Guillain-Barré syndrome:** 
    + Limited data available: Various regimens have been used:
    + Children: IV: 1,000 mg/kg/dose once daily for 2 days or 400 mg/kg/dose once daily for 5 days

-	**Bacterial infection prophylaxis in patients with HIV and hypogammaglobulinemia:** Infants and Children:
    + Primary prophylaxis for serious bacterial infection in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG <400 mg/dL): IV: 400 mg/kg/dose every 2 to 4 weeks.
    + Secondary prophylaxis for invasive bacterial infections: Should only be used if subsequent infections are frequent severe infections (>2 infections during a 1-year period in patients unable to take combination antiretroviral therapy): IV: 400 mg/kg/dose every 2 to 4 weeks.

-	**Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), newly diagnosed:**
Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 800 to 1,000 mg/kg as a single dose or 400 mg/kg/dose once daily for 2 to 5 days. The single dose regimen is preferred, especially if a more rapid increase in platelets is desired; a repeat dose may be administered the following day if an adequate platelet response is not achieved and risk of bleeding remains a concern

-	**Kawasaki disease, treatment:**
    + Note: Use in combination with aspirin; may consider the addition of corticosteroids in high-risk patients and patients with IVIG resistance; may consider dosing based on lean body mass in patients with obesity
    + Infants and Children: IV: 2,000 mg/kg as a single dose infused over 8 to 12 hours; usually administered within 10 days of disease onset; however, may be administered >10 days from onset in patients with delayed diagnosis or with persistent symptoms of systemic inflammation with persistent fever and/or coronary artery aneurysms. If signs and symptoms persist ≥36 hours after completion of the infusion, retreatment with a second dose of 1,000 or 2,000 mg/kg infusion may be considered with or without corticosteroids; a lower second dose has been suggested to minimize risk for adverse drug reactions (eg, hemolytic anemia)
    + Note: A maximum dose has not been defined; a reasonable maximum dose of 100 to 140 g/dose has been suggested during times of drug shortages or when cost is a consideration

-	**Measles, prophylaxis:** 
    + Note: Route of administration varies with product; verify route prior to administration.
    + Preexposure prophylaxis (eg, during an outbreak, travel to endemic area): Note: Indicated for patients already receiving immune globulin therapy.
        - IV: ≥400 mg/kg/dose within 3 weeks before anticipated exposure.
    + Postexposure prophylaxis (in any person without evidence of measles immunity):
        - IM: 0.5 mL/kg/dose (maximum dose: 15 mL/dose) within 6 days of exposure; in adults, doses >10 mL should be split into multiple injections and administered at different sites; in pediatric patients, may also split doses <10 mL based on patient size. Note: Not all immune globulin preparations may be administered by the IM route; of the products currently available on the market, GamaSTAN may be given IM; consult product labeling for additional information as market availability may change. GamaSTAN manufacturer labeling suggests a lower IM dose; however, this dosing was based on previous immune globulin donor potency concentrations; recent data indicates that potency from current donor populations has decreased (ie, measles immunity now from vaccinations instead of immunity from disease) requiring a higher IM immune globulin dose (0.5 mL/kg) in all patients without evidence of measles immunity to ensure adequate serum titers.
        - IV: 400 mg/kg/dose within 6 days of exposure.
    + Immunocompromised: Postexposure prophylaxis: IM: 0.5 mL/kg immediately; maximum dose: 15 mL/dose.
    + Immunocompetent: Postexposure prophylaxis: IM: 0.25 mL/kg within 6 days of exposure. Note: CDC/ACIP recommend 0.5 mL/kg/dose for all patients 

-	**Myocarditis, acute:**
Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 2,000 mg/kg as a single dose. A cohort study of 21 children showed improvement in left ventricular function (LVF) recovery and survival at 1 year as compared to untreated historical cohort; efficacy results are variable; the largest data analysis did not show clear clinical benefit nor positive impact on survival

-	**Myasthenia gravis, severe exacerbation:**
Children: IV: 400 to 1,000 mg/kg/dose once daily over 2 to 5 days for a total dose of 2,000 mg/kg; if additional therapy required, dose should be based on clinical response and titrated to minimum effective dose 

-	**Primary immunodeficiency disorders:** 
Adjust dose/frequency based on desired IgG concentration and clinical response; a trough IgG concentration of ≥500 mg/dL has been recommended by some experts. Liều và cách dùng thay đổi tuỳ theo chế phẩm, xem UTD để biết thông tin chi tiết 

-	**Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN):** 
Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: Usual dose: 1,500 to 2,000 mg/kg total dose as a single dose or divided over 2 to 4 days; dosing based on retrospective reviews and case reports; efficacy results are variable 

-	**Varicella-zoster, postexposure prophylaxis (independent of HIV-status):**
Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Note: Use only if varicella-zoster immune globulin is unavailable.
IV: 400 mg/kg as a single infusion as soon as possible and within 10 days of exposure; ideally within 96 hours of exposure
IM: GamaSTAN: 0.6 to 1.2 mL/kg/dose as a single dose within 72 hours of exposure


### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
IM, IV, SubQ infusion: There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
IV: Use with caution due to risk of immune globulin-induced kidney impairment; the rate of infusion and concentration of solution should be minimized. Discontinue if kidney function deteriorates during treatment.
IM: There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling.

### Contraindications
-	Hypersensitivity to immune globulin or any component of the formulation; 
-	IgA deficiency (with anti-IgA antibodies and history of hypersensitivity [excluding Gammagard S/D]); 
-	hyperprolinemia (Hizentra, Privigen); 
-	hypersensitivity to corn (Octagam 5%); 
-	hereditary intolerance to fructose (Gammaplex 5%); 
-	infants/neonates for whom sucrose or fructose tolerance has not been established (Gammaplex 5%); 
-	hypersensitivity to hyaluronidase, human albumin, or any component of the hyaluronidase formulation (Hyqvia).

### Warnings/Precautions
-	Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions can occur (some severe); patients with known antibodies to IgA are at greater risk; a severe fall in blood pressure may rarely occur with anaphylactic reaction; discontinue therapy and institute immediate treatment (including epinephrine 1 mg/mL) should be available.
-	Aseptic meningitis: Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) has been reported with immune globulin administration; may occur with high doses (≥1 g/kg) and/or rapid infusion. Syndrome usually appears within several hours to 2 days following treatment; usually resolves within several days after product is discontinued. Female patients or patients with a migraine history may be at higher risk for AMS.
-	Hematoma: Do not administer subcutaneously for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia because of the risk of hematoma formation.
-	Hemolysis: Intravenous immune globulin has been associated with antiglobulin hemolysis (acute or delayed). Cases of hemolysis-related renal impairment/failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation have been reported. Risk factors associated with hemolysis include high doses (≥2 g/kg) given either as a single administration or divided over several days, underlying associated inflammatory conditions, and non-O blood type (FDA 2012). An underlying inflammatory state (eg, elevated C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate) may also increase the risk. Closely monitor patients for signs of hemolytic anemia, particularly in patients with preexisting anemia and/or cardiovascular or pulmonary compromise.
-	Hyperproteinemia: Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity, and hyponatremia may occur; distinguish hyponatremia from pseudohyponatremia to prevent volume depletion, a further increase in serum viscosity and a higher risk of thrombotic events.
-	Hypertension: Elevations of blood pressure (systolic ≥180 mm Hg and/or diastolic >120 mm Hg) have been observed during and/or shortly following infusion of Panzyga and Privigen, which resolved with either observation or changes in oral antihypertensive therapy.
-	Infusion reactions: Patients should be monitored for adverse events during and after the infusion. Stop administration with signs of infusion reaction (fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and rarely shock). Risk may be increased with initial treatment, when switching brands of immune globulin, and with treatment interruptions of >8 weeks.
-	Pulmonary edema: Monitor for transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI); noncardiogenic pulmonary edema has been reported with immune globulin use. TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, and fever in the presence of normal left ventricular function. Usually occurs within 1 to 6 hours after infusion.

### Mechanism of Action
Replacement therapy for primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, and IgG antibodies against bacteria, viral, parasitic and mycoplasma antigens; interference with Fc receptors on the cells of the reticuloendothelial system for autoimmune cytopenias and ITP; provides passive immunity by increasing the antibody titer and antigen-antibody reaction potential


### Administration
- Maximum concentration: 12% (Carimune NF)
- Intermittent infusion 10 – 40 mg/mL over 30 minutes.
- IV push: Not indicated
- Suitable diluents: GAMMAGARD LIQUID, Gamunex, and Privigen may be diluted in D5W. Lyophilized and dried concentrate products are reconstituted according to manufacturer’s recommendations
- IV: Infuse over 2 to 24 hours with initial infusion administered slowly and titrated as tolerated; administer in separate infusion line from other medications; if using primary line, flush with NS or D5W (product specific; consult product prescribing information) prior to administration. Decrease dose, rate, and/or concentration of infusion in patients who may be at risk of renal failure. Decreasing the rate or stopping the infusion may help relieve some adverse effects (flushing, changes in pulse rate, changes in blood pressure). Epinephrine should be available during administration.

### Example medical order 

Bệnh nhân 3 tuổi, 12kg, bệnh tay chân miệng độ 3 cần dùng IVIG 

IVIG 2.5g/25ml
- 12g (5 lọ, khoảng 120ml)
- TTM 15 ml/giờ x 1 lần 


### How to prescribe IVIG infusion
1.	For high therapeutic doses (e.g., 1 g/kg/dose), infusion should follow a desensitization protocol:
-	First 30 minutes: IV at 0.5 mL/kg/hour
-	Next 30 minutes: IV at 1 mL/kg/hour
-	Remaining volume: IV at 2 mL/kg/hour
2.	For low doses, for example in the infectious diseases ward for prevention of severe measles complications, a low dose of 0.25 g/kg/dose should be infused over 8 hours.
