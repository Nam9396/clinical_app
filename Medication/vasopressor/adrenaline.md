 
## Adrenaline

### Preparation 
Available as a 1:10,000 concentration (0.1 mg/mL) and 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) concentration. Always use the 1:10,000 concentration for individual doses and the 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) concentration to prepare continuous infusion solution. Protect from light

### Dosing: Neonatal

-	**Safety:** Epinephrine dosage form concentrations are no longer labeled as ratio expressions (eg, 1:1,000); however, a ratio expression of 1:1,000 is equivalent to 1 mg/mL and 1:10,000 is equivalent to 0.1 mg/mL. Epinephrine dosing varies by route of administration; use caution.

-	**Cardiopulmonary resuscitation:**
    + IV, Intraosseous: 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg (0.1 to 0.3 mL/kg of 0.1 mg/mL solution), followed immediately by NS flush; may repeat dose every 3 to 5 minutes as needed.
    + Endotracheal: Note: IV route preferred: Endotracheal: 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg (0.5 to 1 mL/kg of 0.1 mg/mL solution) every 3 to 5 minutes until IV access established or return of spontaneous circulation.

-	**Hypotension; fluid refractory/dopamine resistant shock:**  Limited data available: 
    + Preterm and term neonates: Continuous IV or intraosseous infusion
    + Using 1 mg/ml solution
    + Initial: 0.1 mcg/kg/minute; usual range: 0.05 to 0.5 mcg/kg/minute; maximum recommended dose: 1 mcg/kg/minute; doses up to 2.6 mcg/kg/minute have been reported; optimal approach to dose titration is not established and varies based on clinical scenario

### Dosing: Pediatric
-	**Asystole or pulseless arrest:**
    + IV, Intraosseous (preferred routes of administration): 0.01 mg/kg (0.1 mL/kg of 0.1 mg/mL solution) immediately after initiating CPR (within 5 minutes of starting chest compressions), maximum dose: 1 mg/dose; repeat every 3 to 5 minutes until return of spontaneous circulation.
    + Endotracheal: 0.1 mg/kg (0.1 mL/kg of 1 mg/mL solution) immediately after initiating CPR (within 5 minutes of starting chest compressions), maximum dose: 2.5 mg/dose; repeat every 3 to 5 minutes until return of spontaneous circulation or IV/intraosseous access established. Note: Recent clinical studies suggest that lower epinephrine concentrations delivered by endotracheal administration may produce transient beta 2-adrenergic effects which may be detrimental (eg, hypotension, lower coronary artery perfusion pressure). IV or intraosseous are the preferred methods of administration.

-	**Bradycardia**
    + IV, Intraosseous: 0.01 mg/kg (0.1 mL/kg of 0.1 mg/mL solution) (maximum dose: 1 mg/dose or 10 mL/dose); may repeat every 3 to 5 minutes as needed.
    + Endotracheal: 0.1 mg/kg (0.1 mL/kg of 1 mg/mL solution) (maximum dose: 2.5 mg/dose); doses as high as 0.2 mg/kg may be effective; may repeat every 3 to 5 minutes as needed until IV/intraosseous access established. Note: Recent clinical studies suggest that lower epinephrine concentrations delivered by endotracheal administration may produce transient beta 2-adrenergic effects which may be detrimental (eg, hypotension, lower coronary artery perfusion pressure). IV or intraosseous are the preferred methods of administration.

-	**Cardiac output increase or maintenance/post resuscitation stabilization:**
    + Continuous IV or intraosseous infusion: 0.05 to 1 mcg/kg/minute
    + doses <0.3 mcg/kg/minute generally produce beta-adrenergic effects and higher doses (>0.3 mcg/kg/minute) generally produce alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction; titrate dosage to desired effect

-	**Hypersensitivity reaction/anaphylaxis:** Note: With parenteral administration, the preferred route of administration is IM administration in the anterolateral aspect of the middle third of the thigh; SUBQ administration results in slower absorption and is less reliable 
    + General dosing or health care settings: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IM: 0.01 mg/kg/dose (0.01 mL/kg/dose of 1 mg/mL solution) not to exceed: Prepubertal child: 0.3 mg/dose; adolescent: 0.5 mg/dose; administered every 5 to 15 minutes; usual practice is to administer up to 3 doses, but more doses may be needed in some cases
    + Refractory cases:Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Continuous IV infusion: Prepared 1 mcg/mL solution: Initial: 0.1 mcg/kg/minute; titrate dose to response. Usual range: 0.1 to 1 mcg/kg/minute; maximum dose: 10 mcg/minute. Note: Suggested concentration of initial solution is more dilute than those typically utilized in other clinical conditions; evaluate infusion concentration with continued therapy and patient fluid status.
    + Hypotension/Shock, fluid resistant: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Continuous IV or intraosseous infusion: 0.1 to 1 mcg/kg/minute; rates >0.3 mcg/kg/minute associated with vasopressor activity

### Contraindications
There are no absolute contraindications to the use of intranasal (Neffy) or injectable epinephrine (including Adrenaclick, Auvi-Q, EpiPen, EpiPen Jr, Symjepi, Allerject [Canadian product], and Twinject [Canadian product]) in a life-threatening situation. The manufacturer’s labeling for some injectable products include the following contraindications: Hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines; general anesthesia with halogenated hydrocarbons (eg, halothane) or cyclopropane; narrow angle glaucoma; nonanaphylactic shock; in combination with local anesthesia of certain areas such as fingers, toes, and ears; use in situations where vasopressors may be contraindicated (eg, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes, in obstetrics when maternal blood pressure is in excess of 130/80 mm Hg and in hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders).

### Warnings/Precautions
- Cardiac effects: May precipitate or aggravate angina pectoris or induce cardiac arrhythmias; use with caution especially in patients with cardiac disease or those receiving drugs that sensitize the myocardium.
- Extravasation: IV administration: Vesicant; ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during infusion. Avoid extravasation.
- Pulmonary edema: Due to peripheral constriction and cardiac stimulation, pulmonary edema may occur.
- Renal effects: Due to renal blood vessel constriction, decreased urine output may occur.
- Compared to dopamine, continuous infusions at doses yielding similar changes in blood pressure are more likely to cause hyperglycemia, tachycardia, and elevations in serum lactate. Cardiac arrhythmias (PVCs and ventricular tachycardia) are also more likely. Renal vascular ischemia may occur at higher doses. Bolus doses are associated with severe hypertension and intracranial hemorrhage. Increased myocardial oxygen
requirements. IV infiltration may cause tissue ischemia and necrosis. Suggested treatment: Inject a 1
mg/mL solution of phentolamine into the affected area. The usual amount needed is 1 to 5 mL, depending on the size of the infiltrate

### Administration
-	Endotracheal:
    + Neonates: Use 0.1 mg/mL solution.
    + Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Use 1 mg/mL solution; administer and flush with a minimum of 5 mL NS, followed by 5 manual ventilations.

-	Parenteral:
    + Direct IV or intraosseous: If using 0.1 mg/mL concentration, no dilution is necessary; the 1 mg/mL concentration must be further diluted.
    + Continuous IV infusion: Administer as a continuous infusion via an infusion pump. Must be diluted prior to administration. Central line administration is preferred; extravasation may cause severe ischemic necrosis. If central line not available, may administer for a short duration through a peripheral IV catheter placed in a large vein or via intraosseous access using a more dilute solution or with a second carrier fluid; frequent monitoring of the IV catheter site is recommended to rapidly identify extravasation. Avoid use of ankle veins (due to potential for gangrene), leg veins in those with occlusive vascular diseases (eg, diabetic endarteritis, Buerger disease, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis).
        + Rate of infusion (mL/hour) = dose (mcg/kg/minute) × weight (kg) × 60 minutes/hour divided by the concentration (mcg/mL)
        + Vesicant; ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during infusion; avoid extravasation. If extravasation occurs, stop infusion immediately; leave cannula/needle in place but do NOT flush the line; gently aspirate extravasated solution, then remove needle/cannula; elevate extremity; apply dry warm compresses. Initiate phentolamine (or alternative antidote)

-	IM, Autoinjectors (eg, Auvi-Q, EpiPen, EpiPen Jr): Intramuscularly into anterolateral aspect of the middle of the thigh is preferred in the setting of anaphylaxis. Administer through clothing if necessary. Before administering to a child, immobilize leg to prevent laceration or other injury and consider restraining children who are likely to move during administration. Although the manufacturers of auto-injectors recommend varying lengths of time for holding the device in the thigh (range: 2 to 10 seconds), longer times have occasionally resulted in injury. For all devices, the needle should remain in the thigh for the least amount of time as possible. With nearly every device, the full dose is delivered within 3 seconds. For EpiPen, holding the device against the leg followed by removing the cap and then compressing has been described for easier administration. Never reinsert needles. Do not administer repeated injections at the same site. Do not inject into the buttocks or into digits, hands, or feet. If injected into buttocks, administer a second dose into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. If injected into the digits, hands, or feet, administer a second dose into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh and immediately go to the nearest emergency room (inform health care provider of location of accidental injection). More than 2 sequential doses should only be administered under direct medical supervision. Some products are single-use products and a new device should be used for each dose; consult product-specific labeling. Note: In children who are overweight or obese, because skin surface to muscle depth is greater in the upper half of the thigh, administration into the lower half of the thigh may be preferred. In children who are very obese, injection into the calf will provide an even greater chance of intramuscular administration

- Suitable diluents: –LR, D–S, D5LR, D5NS, D5W, D10W, LR, NS. Not compatible with alkaline or oxidizing
solutions such as sodium bicarbonate and nitrites

- Maximum concentration: 0.1 mg/mL (1:10,000 dilution) for IV push and IO administration or 1 mg/mL (1:1000
dilution) for ET administration and IV/IO in select cases of overdose.

### Infusion-related cautions
- Bradycardia, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, syncope, weakness, renal failure, and hypertension have occurred.
- Extravasation may cause local ischemia and tissue necrosis. Therefore, infusion should be via a secure peripheral catheter or, preferably, a central route. To prevent necrosis, aliquots of phentolamine mesylate (0.1–0.2 mg/kg up to 10 mg in 10 mL NS) should be injected intradermally into the ischemic area.(13) IO infusion may be used while attaining central access

### Mechanism of Action
Stimulates alpha-, beta1-, and beta2-adrenergic receptors resulting in relaxation of smooth muscle of the bronchial tree, cardiac stimulation (increasing myocardial oxygen consumption), and dilation of skeletal muscle vasculature; small doses can cause vasodilation via beta2-vascular receptors; large doses may produce constriction of skeletal and vascular smooth muscle
