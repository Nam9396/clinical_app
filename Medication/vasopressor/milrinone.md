 
## Milrinone

### Preparation 
- Milrinone 1mg/1ml

### General dosing

- Bệnh tay chân miệng
    + Dùng trong mức độ 3 của bệnh, chỉ khi bệnh nhân có tăng huyết áp 
    + Không có liều loading 
    + Truyền tĩnh mạch liên tục: 0.4 - 0.75 mcg/kg/phút trong 24 - 72 giờ 
    + Nếu huyết áp ổn định trong 12 - 24 giờ, giảm dần liều 0.1 mcg/kg/phút mỗi 30 - 60 phút cho đến liều tối thiểu 0.25 mcg/kg/phút. Nếu huyết áp ổn định trong 6 giờ với liều này thì thì xem xét ngưng thuốc

-	**Hemodynamic support (eg, acute decompensated heart failure, cardiogenic shock, fluid-refractory, catecholamine-resistant septic shock):** 
    + Loading dose (optional): IV, Intraosseous: 50 mcg/kg administered over 10 to 60 minutes followed by a continuous IV or intraosseous infusion. Note: Due to the risk of hypotension, some centers do not utilize a loading dose
    + Continuous IV or intraosseous infusion: Dose range: 0.25 to 0.75 mcg/kg/minute; titrate dose to effect
    + Loading dose of 25 mcg/kg over 10 minutes followed by doses up to 0.75 mcg/kg/min have been used specically to decreased the risk of peripheral necrosis (i.e., toes) associated with meningococcal sepsis

-	**Low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) following congenital heart disease (CHD) corrective surgery, prevention:**
    + IV: Loading dose: 75 mcg/kg administered over 60 minutes followed 
    + By a continuous IV infusion of 0.75 mcg/kg/minute.


### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
No dosage adjustments necessary.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
Infants, Children, and Adolescents: There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling. Milrinone clearance is significantly reduced and other pharmacokinetic parameters (eg, volume of distribution) have shown a high degree of interpatient variability in pediatric patients with acute kidney injury; doses should be individualized and titration based upon hemodynamic and clinical response rather than an algorithmic approach based upon dose adjustment for estimated creatinine clearance

### Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to milrinone or any component of the formulation

**Disease-related concerns**
-	Cardiovascular disease: Avoid use in patients with severe obstructive aortic or pulmonic valvular disease in lieu of surgical relief of the obstruction; may aggravate outflow tract obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with outflow tract obstruction.
-	Electrolyte imbalance: Correct electrolyte disturbances, especially hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, prior to use and throughout therapy to minimize the risk of arrhythmias.
-	Kidney impairment: Use with caution in patients with kidney impairment; reduction in infusion rate recommended. Hypotension may be prolonged in patients with kidney dysfunction

### Warnings/Precautions
-	Arrhythmias: Ventricular arrhythmias, including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular arrhythmias, have been reported. Observe closely for arrhythmias in this very high-risk patient population; sudden cardiac death has been observed. Due to the prolonged half-life as compared to other inotropic agents, ventricular or atrial arrhythmias may persist even after discontinuation of milrinone especially in patients with kidney dysfunction. Ensure that ventricular rate is controlled in atrial fibrillation/flutter before initiating; may increase ventricular response rate. In heart transplant candidates, institute appropriate measures to protect patient against risks of sudden cardiac death.

-	Hypotension: Hypotension may occur. Monitor blood pressure closely. Hypotension may be prolonged especially in patients with kidney dysfunction. Vigorous diuresis may contribute to hypotension; cautious administration of fluids may be required to prevent hypotension. Omitting the bolus dose may decrease the risk of hypotension. If hypotension occurs, consider dose reduction or temporary discontinuation.


### Administration
- Maximum concentration: 200 mcg/mL
- Loading dose may be given undiluted but may be diluted to allow for ease of administration
- IV Push: Milrinone has been given over 30 seconds, but most suggest a longer infusion time
- Intermittent infusion: Most references suggest that the loading dose should be given over 10–60 minutes
- Continuous infusion with maximum concentration <= 200 mcg/mL
- Suitable diluents D5W, NS, LR, ½NS

### Example medical order
Bệnh nhân nam, 3 tuổi, 11kg, bệnh tay chân miệng, huyết áp tăng 140/90mmHg, cần dùng milrinone để hạ áp

Milrinone 1 mg/ml 
- 6.5mg 
- Pha với NaCl 0.9% vừa đủ 25ml 
- TTM 1 ml/h
- (~0.4 mcg/kg/phút)

### Monitoring
- Milrinone is a positive inotrope and vasodilator that has little chronotropic activity. It does produce a slight shortening of an atrioventricular (AV) node conduction time, indicating a potential for an increased ventricular response rate
- What to be monitored: 
    + Blood pressure, heart rate should be monitored during infusion for supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias
    + ECG 
    + Fluid status
    + AST, ALT 

### Mechanism of Action
Milrinone improves cardiac output by enhancing myocardial contractility, enhancing myocardial diastolic relaxation and decreasing vascular resistance. It acts via selective phosphodiesterase III inhibition that leads to increased intracellular cyclic AMP, increased myocardial intracellular calcium, and increased reuptake of calcium after
systole. Vasodilatation is related to increased levels of cyclic GMP in vascular smooth muscle. Unlike catecholamines, myocardial oxygen consumption is not increased

### Dosing for neonate
- Uses: Short-term (less than 72 hours) treatment of acute low cardiac output after cardiac surgery or due to septic shock
- Loading dose: 75 mcg/kg IV infused over 60 minutes, immediately followed by 
- Maintenance infusion: 0.5 to 0.75 mcg/kg per minute.

**Premature infants less than 30 weeks GA:**
- Loading dose: 135 mcg/kg IV infused over 3 hours, immediately followed by
- Maintenance infusion: 0.2 mcg/kg per minute.
