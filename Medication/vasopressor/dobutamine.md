 
## Dobutamine

### Preparation 
Supplied as 250 mg per 20-mL vial (12.5 mg/mL) and premixed bags in concentrations of 1, 2, and 4 mg/mL. Diluted solutions for infusion should be used within 24 hours. Solutions containing dobutamine and dextrose may exhibit a pink color which will increase with time due to oxidation of the drug. There is no significant loss of potency. There are no specific data regarding the compatibility of dobutamine and fat emulsions.
Dobutamine is most stable in solutions with a pH at or below 5. In alkaline solutions, the catechol moieties are oxidized, cyclized, and polymerized to colored materials. All fat emulsions have pH ranges from 6 to 9. Caution is urged when co-infusing dobutamine and fat emulsion together; dobutamine may degrade over time in this alkaline pH resulting in lower than expected clinical effects

### General dosing
- **Maximum dosage**: 40 mcg/kg/min has been used; however, this dose is associated with increased risk of
toxicity

-	**Hemodynamic support:** Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Continuous IV or intraosseous infusion: 
    + Initial: 0.5 to 1 mcg/kg/minute; 
    + titrate gradually every few minutes until desired response achieved; usual range: 2 to 20 mcg/kg/minute.

### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling.

### Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to dobutamine or sulfites (some contain sodium metabisulfate), or any component of the formulation; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with outflow tract obstruction (formerly known as idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis).

### Warnings/Precautions
-	Cardiovascular: Angina pectoris (1% to 3%), chest pain (1% to 3%), increased heart rate (10%), increased systolic blood pressure (8%), palpitations (1% to 3%), premature ventricular contractions (5%)
-	Gastrointestinal: Nausea (1% to 3%)
-	Nervous system: Headache (1% to 3%)
-	Respiratory: Dyspnea (1% to 3%)
-   DOBUTamine may increase heart rate or blood pressure. DOBUTamine use in patients with atrial fibrillation increases risk of rapid ventricular response; use of digoxin prior to DOBUTamine should be used in patients
with atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular response. Patients with hypertension are at increased risk of exaggerated pressor response with DOBUTamine. DOBUTamine may also cause ventricular ectopic activity

### Administration
- Maximum concentration: 5 mg/mL    
- Intermittent infusion: Not indicated
- IV push: Not indicated
- Continuous infusion:
    + 0.25–5 mg/mL
    + The Joint Commission recommends the use of standardized concentrations of vasoactive medications
    + The ISMP and Vermont Oxford Network recommend a standard concentration of 2 mg/mL for neonates
- Suitable diluents: D5W, D5NS, NS, D5½NS, D10W, LR,(6,24) D5LR, ½NS, Isolyte M with dextrose5%, Normosol-M in D5W, 20% Osmitrol in Water for Injection, or sodium lactate injection. Not compatible with strongly alkaline solutions such as sodium bicarbonate or diluents containing both sodium bisulfite and ethanol

### Mechanism of Action
Dobutamine, a racemic mixture, stimulates myocardial beta1-adrenergic receptors primarily by the (+) enantiomer and some alpha1 receptor agonism by the (-) enantiomer, resulting in increased contractility and heart rate, and stimulates both beta2- and alpha1-receptors in the vasculature. Although beta2 and alpha1 adrenergic receptors are also activated, the effects of beta2 receptor activation may equally offset or be slightly greater than the effects of alpha1 stimulation, resulting in some vasodilation in addition to the inotropic and chronotropic actions. Lowers central venous pressure and wedge pressure, but has little effect on pulmonary vascular resistance.

### Dosing for neonate
- 2 to 25 mcg/kg per minute continuous IV infusion. Begin at a low dose and titrate by monitoring effects. Use a large vein for IV.
