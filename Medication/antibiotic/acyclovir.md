 
## Acyclovir

### Preparation 
Intravenous formulations available as solution (50 mg/mL) or as powder for solution in 500-mg and 1-g vials. Prepare powder for solution by dissolving contents of 500-mg vial in 10 mL sterile water for injection. Reconstituted solution is stable at room temperature for 12 hours. Do not refrigerate


### General dosing

- **Maximum dosage:** Do not exceed 20 mg/kg q 8 hr

-	**Safety:** In patients with obesity, an estimate of ideal body weight or an adjusted body weight is recommended for dose calculation to avoid dose-related toxicity (eg, acute kidney injury)

-	**Herpes simplex virus encephalitis, treatment:**
    + Infants >4 months and Children <12 years: IV: 10 to 15 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for 21 days. Note: Due to increased risk of neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, higher doses (20 mg/kg) are not routinely recommended; if used, monitor closely
    + Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: IV: 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for 21 days

-	**Herpes simplex virus, progressive or disseminated infection, treatment (immunocompromised host):**
    + Patients without HIV: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for 7 to 14 days
    + Patients with HIV:
        - Infants and Children: IV: 10 to 15 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for 21 days
        - Adolescents: IV: 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for 21 days

-	**Herpes zoster (shingles), treatment:**
    
    **Oral therapy (immunocompetent host, or host with HIV with mild, uncomplicated disease and no or moderate immunosuppression):**
    + Infants and Children <12 years: Oral: 20 mg/kg/dose 4 times daily; maximum dose: 800 mg/dose. Treat for 5 days in immunocompetent hosts and 7 to 10 days in patients with HIV; consider longer course in patients with HIV if resolution of lesions is slow
    + Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: Oral: 800 mg 5 times daily. Treat for 5 to 7 days in immunocompetent hosts, and 7 to 10 days in patients with HIV; consider longer course in patients with HIV if resolution of lesions is slow
    
    **IV therapy (immunocompromised host [including patients with HIV] or immunocompetent hosts who require parenteral therapy [eg, severe, disseminated disease]):**
    + Infants, Children, and Adolescents: 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours or 500 mg/m2/dose every 8 hours for 7 to 10 days. 
    + Higher doses of 15 to 20 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours have been recommended for disseminated or CNS infection. May convert to oral therapy once clinical improvement is observed and no new lesions for 48 hours to complete a 10- to 14-day course in immunocompromised patients


### Dosing: Liver Impairment: Pediatric
No dosage adjustments necessary.

### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
Monitor closely for neurotoxicity: Infants, Children and Adolescents:
-	CrCl >50 mL/minute/1.73 m2: IV: No dosage adjustment necessary
-	CrCl 25 to 50 mL/minute/1.73 m2: IV: Administer the usual recommended dose every 12 hours
-	CrCl 10 to <25 mL/minute/1.73 m2: IV: Administer the usual recommended dose every 24 hours
-	CrCl <10 mL/minute/1.73 m2: IV: Administer 50% of the usual recommended dose every 24 hours (eg, if the usual recommended dose is 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours, then administer 5 mg/kg/dose every 24 hours)


### Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to acyclovir, valacyclovir, or any component of the formulation

### Warnings/Precautions
-	**Acute kidney injury:** Acyclovir may cause acute kidney injury, resulting most often from obstructive nephropathy but may also be due to interstitial nephritis or renal tubular necrosis in adult and pediatric patients. Kidney injury is reversible in most cases after dosage reduction or discontinuation; however, some cases may not return to baseline
-	**Neurotoxicity**: Acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity most commonly includes reported symptoms such as agitation, confusion, dysarthria, hallucination, and impaired consciousness. Other reported symptoms include aphasia, ataxia, myoclonus, tremor, and seizure (including status epilepticus). Most cases of neurotoxicity are reversible after discontinuation with or without hemodialysis; however, some cases may not be fully reversible
-	**Thrombotic microangiopathy**: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), manifestations of thrombotic microangiopathy, have been reported with both acyclovir and valacyclovir. TTP/HUS may result in damage to the brain, heart, kidney, liver, and pancreas. Resolution has been reported with discontinuation and appropriate therapy.
-	**Extravasation:** Acyclovir IV is an irritant (depending on concentration); avoid extravasation.
-	**Varicella:** Appropriate use: For maximum benefit, treatment should begin within 24 hours of appearance of rash; oral route not recommended for routine use in otherwise healthy children with varicella but may be effective in patients at increased risk of moderate to severe infection (>12 years of age, chronic cutaneous or pulmonary disorders, long-term salicylate therapy, corticosteroid therapy).


### Administration
- Maximum concentration <= 7 mg/ml
- Intermittent infusion: The dose should be infused over 1 hour to minimize renal dysfunction
- IV push: not recommended
- Suitable diluents D5W and NS
- Solution Incompatibility Dex/AA

-	**Oral:** May administer with or without food; shake suspension well before use. Maintain adequate hydration during therapy.
-	**Parenteral:** Administer by slow IV infusion over at least 1 hour; rapid infusion is associated with nephrotoxicity due to crystalluria and renal tubular damage and should be avoided. Maintain adequate hydration during therapy. Do not administer IV push, IM, or SUBQ.
-	Acyclovir IV may be an irritant with vesicant-like properties; ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during IV infusion; avoid extravasation. If extravasation occurs, stop infusion immediately; leave cannula/needle in place temporarily but do NOT flush the line; gently aspirate extravasated solution, then remove needle/cannula; elevate extremity; apply dry warm compresses; initiate hyaluronidase antidote in addition to supportive management for refractory cases 


### Dosing for neonate

-	**Varicella (chickenpox), treatment:** Limited data available; optimal dose has not been established: Preterm and term neonates: IV: 10 to 15 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for 7 to 10 days; continue for ≥48 hours after the last new lesions have appeared; doses of 20 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours have also been reported.
