### Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric
Infants, Children, and Adolescents:
IV, Oral (immediate release): There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling; however, the following guidelines have been used by some clinicians:
- GFR ≥30 mL/minute/1.73 m2: No dosage adjustment necessary.
- GFR 10 to 29 mL/minute/1.73 m2: 10 to 15 mg/kg/dose every 18 hours.

- CRRT: 10 to 15 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours.

### Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin, any component of the formulation, or other quinolones; concurrent administration of tizanidine
- Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.

### Warnings/Precautions
- **Arthropathy/arthralgia**: AAP states that cipro oxacin seems to be well tolerated and does not appear to cause arthropathy. Use of cipro oxacin in  pediatric patients is justiable if no other agent is available, and  infection is caused by multidrug-resistant, gram-negative, enteric, or one of several other pathogens

- Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity events have been reported. These generally occur following multiple doses and manifestations as one or more of the following:
    - fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
    - vasculitis, arthralgia, or myalgia
    - serum sickness
    - allergic pneumonitis
    - interstitial nephritis, acute renal insuf ciency or failure
    - hepatitis, jaundice, acute hepatic necrosis or failure
    - anemia (including  hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia (including thrombotic thrombocytopenic  purpura), leukopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and/or other hematologic  abnormalities. There may be an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions in HIV-seropositive patients

- **CNS effects/neuroexcitation**: Fluoroquinolones have been associated with a range of neurologic and psychiatric effects, ranging from dizziness and restlessness to toxic psychosis (Ref). Additional reactions include confusion, agitation, insomnia, and drowsiness. More severe reactions include delusions, hallucinations, suicidal ideation, suicidal tendencies, and toxic psychosis. Neuroexcitation may include seizure in some patients
- **Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia**: have been associated with the use of fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin 
- **QT prolongation**: Fluoroquinolones may be associated with prolonged QT interval on ECG and ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes (TdP). Ciprofloxacin may have a lower risk than other fluoroquinolones, particularly moxifloxacin (Ref). Change in QTc from baseline for moxifloxacin was found to be +16.34 to 17.83 ms, while the change with ciprofloxacin was +2.27 to 4.93 ms 
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Fluoroquinolones have been associated with peripheral neuropathy and other effects, including axonal neuropathy and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) (Ref). Fluoroquinolones are associated with many types of disturbances of special senses, including several case reports indicating a very slow recovery and/or permanent state of disability 
- **Hepatotoxicity**: Ciprofloxacin may cause hepatotoxicity; cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed patterns are represented in reported clinical presentations 

### Administration
- Maximum concentration 2 mg/mL
- Intermittent infusion   0.5 – 2 mg/mL over 60 minutes
- IV push Not recommended
- Suitable diluents D5W, D10W, NS, D5NS, D5LR, Normosol-M in D5, or Normosol – R in D5

### Dosing for neonate
- The AAP recommends that ciprooxacin is not appropriate in mild-to-moderate infections
- Neonates:  A recent systematic review has reported doses ranging from 10 – 60 mg/kg/day, typically divided BID, in term and preterm neonates. Most regimens ranged from 10 – 20 mg/kg/day divided BID. No serious adverse effects were reported
