- **Maximum dosage**: 45 mg/kg/day divided q 8 hr was given to a 7-week-old infant. 1200 mg/day if  > 12 years of age

-	**Safety:** The risk of serious hematologic and neurologic toxicity increases after >2 weeks and >4 weeks of therapy, respectively. When prolonged therapy is required, alternative agents are preferred; if benefits of linezolid outweigh risks and prolonged therapy is used, monitor closely.

-	**General dosing**
    + Infants and Children <12 years: Oral, IV: 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours, maximum dose: 600 mg/dose.
    + Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: Oral, IV: 600 mg every 12 hours.

-	**Bloodstream infection, resistant gram-positive infection (eg, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus):**
    + Note: Duration of therapy varies based on various clinical factors including causative pathogen, source of bacteremia, and response 
    + Infants and Children <12 years: Oral, IV: 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours; maximum dose: 600 mg/dose
    + Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: Oral, IV: 600 mg every 12 hours OR 10 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours; maximum dose: 600 mg/dose 

-	**Meningitis, including health care–associated ventriculitis/meningitis (eg, cerebrospinal fluid shunt infection) (alternative agent):** Limited data available:
    + Note: Duration should be individualized based on patient characteristics and response; typical duration is 10 to 14 days; longer durations required for abscess or empyema
